#### Q1.

Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number
    int x{}; // define variable x to hold user input
    std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x
    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

The program expects you to enter an integer value, as the variable x that the user input, will be put into is an integer variable.

Run this program multiple times and describe the output that results when you enter the following types of input:

- A letter, such as h.

- A number with a fractional part (e.g. 3.2). Try numbers with fractional parts less than 0.5 and greater than 0.5 (e.g. 3.2 and 3.7).

- A small negative integer, such as -3.

- A word, such as Hello.

- A really big number (at least 3 billion (300 crores) i.e. 3000000000 (3 with nine zeros)).

- A small number followed by some letters, such as 123abc.

- A few letters followed by a small number, such as abc123.

- +5 (three spaces, followed by a plus symbol, and a 5).

- 5b6.

#### Q2.

Ask the user to enter three values. The program should then print these values. Add an appropriate comment above function `main()`.

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
// (when run with input values 4, 5, and 6)

Enter three numbers: 4 5 6
You entered 4, 5, and 6.
```
