The average of 5, 9, and 16 is 10. // (5 + 9 + 16) / 3 = 10
```

#### Q3.

Write a program to calculate the perimeter and the area of a rectangle.
Take the length and the width of a rectangle from user and then prints the value of perimeter and area of that given rectangle.

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
Enter the length & width of a rectangle: 10 5 // (user enters these values on console)
Perimeter: 30
Area: 50

// Perimeter = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (10 + 5) = 30
// Area = l * w = 10 * 5 = 50
```

#### Q4.

Write a program that takes the cost of any 3 food items from the user (e.g. a packet of biscuit, a packet of waffer, an icecream cone). Then 
- print the **Total Cost** of the items
- then calculate a 18% GST (tax) on the total cost of the items and print that **GST Amount**
- finally print the **Total Bill** amount, adding Total Cost & GST Amount

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
Enter the cost of 3 food items: 50 20 60 // (user enters these amounts on console)
Total Cost: 130
GST Amount : 23.4
Total Bill: 153.4

// Total Cost = 50 + 20 + 60 = 130
// GST Amount = (130 * 18) / 100 = 23.4
// Total Bill = 130 + 23.4 = 153.4
```
