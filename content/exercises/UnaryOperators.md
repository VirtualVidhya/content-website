(**NOTE:** In all the below exercises **y**ou have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code. Predict the value of each variable after that statement gets executed.)

for e.g.

```jsx
let a - 1;       // a = 1
a++;             // a = 2
let b = a + 3;   // a = 2     b = 5
let c = a + b;   // a = 2     b = 5     c = 7
```

```jsx
let num = 5;
let newNum = num++;
newNum = ++num;
```

2. 

What is the value of each variable in each line of code?

```jsx
let x = 5;             
let y = --x;           
let z = y--;           
x = ++z;               
y = --z;               
z = x++;               
```
