What is "Internet"? You are learning Web Development, so what is "Web"?

What do we do generally do on the Internet? What exactly do we use it for?

### Fundamental workings of the Internet Communication

We use Internet to consume information, be it any form (books, movies, pictures etc.).
We are basically communicating via digital devices (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop) over some connecting medium called Internet.
While consuming content, we are receiving them (as a **client**) and that content is getting served to us from somewhere (as a **server**).
When we are on our device, we as a client make a **request** that I want to get this information, this request leave our **client-side device** and find itself all the way to a remote **server-side device** somewhere, that server can hear our requests and **respond** with something, via which our request gets served. This is the backbone of the Internet, in the most fundamental way, this is how the Internet works.

If I had a document and I want to open it on my computer, what will I do? I'd use some document viewer software (e.g. MS Word) on my computer. If PDF, some PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat). So, we have these tools/softwares, basically programs which are really good at opening certain types of files, while running on our client-side devices. Similarly, we have a program called **browser** in our computers (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge, Safari), which is really good at opening files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and through that we are able to see things on our computer screens. Via this browser on our client device, we are able to make a requests to a server, that server is just an another computer out there on the internet which can hear that request and has some program/code that tells it what to do. 

Let's take an example of a restaurant, you as a client can make requests from your table to the kitchen and the kitchen as a server/backend serves you the food as per your request. You don't really care about what's happening in the kitchen, you just care that the kitchen gives you the food. That's the exact same thing happening on the Internet, you as a client from your device are making requests, those requests go to some server and you get information back. The beautiful thing here is that all our devices have a program called browser and this browser can run the files which are being sent back from the server, so when we get the food served, there are some things that we can eat and there are some that we couldn't eat well. The server works the same way, the server can send you a file that the browser has no idea what to do with, but the browser can handle these HTML, CSS, JS files.

Now let's say, we want to order a pizza from *dominoes*, for that we type *dominoes.com* in the browser on our device, that request goes to a dominoes server and then they are going to respond with HTML, CSS & JS, these are actual individual files but they handle something different. Once the response comes back to our device, we can see a complete dominoes website. All the content we can see on that website is all powered by **HTML**, be it text, image etc. Now the content you see with different colors, sizes, positioning, alignments, style is all powered by **CSS**. Now on that website, you can click on buttons, drag things around, interact, this is all powered by **JavaScript**. This all stuff is happening on our client side, we are seeing all this on our device but there's a lot of stuff that has to happen on that server. They have to be able to process our credit cards for payments, they have to able to keep track of our order history, they have to be able to show us food items based on our selection, now all these things that we never see is happening on the server-side.

Now under the web development, there are different roles i.e. full stack developer, front-end developer, back-end developer. 
The people who just focus on the things that user sees are **client-side or front-end developers**, people who focuses on the things that happens behind the scene on the server are **server-side or back-end developers** and the people who can do both are **full-stack developers**.

We have come to know that this whole digital communication is about sending requests and getting responses, now interesting thing is that these requests & responses are going across real wires.

These wires enable our communication across the world.

These wires have multiple fibre cables inside them and they are capable of tranferring signals at a very high speed. We ourselves have observed how fast the response we get based on our request over the internet and the responses are coming from all over the world. While understanding requests & responses, we only took client and server into consideration for the communication but there are a lot of other things that happen in the background to make this whole communication possible.
When we first make a request from our device, the request goes through our **wifi** or **ethernet** cable to **router** through **modem**, then the first place this request is going to go to is **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**, the ISPs are the individual private service providers to whom we pay money to get connected to these giant network of internet wires. That giant network is mostly maintained by government and other giant bodies, these ISPs really just connect our individual houses/offices to that giant network. Next, our request will go to **DNS (Domain Name Server/System)**. DNS is just another computer out there on this network which is really good at doing one thing, in short, it's really a fancy phone book. For e.g. if you invite me over your home, then you need to give me the address of your home to reach, but still it doesn't guarantee that I will able to find it but if you give the exact GPS co-ordinates of your home, I will surely able to find it. So, when we type in dominoes.com in the browser, that's not enough to find that server, we need something called an **IP (Internet Protocol) Address**. This DNS just contains all the web-address & their IP-address (dominoes.com - 139.772.444.101). Why do we need this? Well, if you gave me the GPS co-ordinates of your home (27.9881° N, 86.9250° E) then it'll be really hard to remember it and imagine having to remember such co-ordinates for multiple people's homes! So rather than remembering the co-ordinates, we can just simply have addresses - 32, Cherry Street. So, in real life we have addresses, on the internet we have URLs - dominoes.com, dominoes.com is the address but it's not the co-ordinates of that server, so we need a DNS, when we give it the dominoes.com url, it gives us the IP address (139.772.444.101), with this we can find the server and reach there. Yes, there are multiple other steps involved in between as well but this gives us the general overview. That server has code running on it, which hears that request comes in and knows what to do, it processes the request, once it finishes, it sends back the response. That response also goes through all the hoops that we've gone through previously again. All of this works because of **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**, it is the rules/ways via which we are able to make these requests and send these responses. Now the change has been made to this protocol, with simple HTTP, all the requests and responses you get over this network are all public so anyone on this network can see all the requests, responses and other linked information but now the **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secured)** is introduced so all things are encrypted, though the information like what's being requested, where it's coming from, what type of computer it's on, the site that's getting requested (url) can still be seen. Now ISPs can record all these information and sell that information to the highest bidder. Have you used the **Incognito Browser**? Well, it doesn't really do anything, the only thing it does is that it doesn't store your previous search, download data locally on your machine, your ISP can still knows all the information. You can use **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** to make things a bit more secure, VPN is simply someone else's computer that you send your encrypted traffic to and then that computer makes the request on your behalf and then decrypts to send the response back. People generally think that VPNs are more secure but VPN is only secure in the sense that you trust that VPN provider more than your ISP. You can use things like TOR, Onion Network where your requests gets bounced around different devices to make things more secure.
