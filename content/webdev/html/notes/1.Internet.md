What is "Internet"? You are learning to be a Web Developer, so first of all, what is "Web"?

![Client-Server](../../../../images/notes/HTML/1.Internet/1.png)

What do we do generally do on the Internet? What exactly do we use it for?

We use Internet to consume information, be it any form (books, movies, pictures etc.).
We are basically communicating via digital devices (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop) over some connecting medium called Internet.
While consuming content, we are receiving them (as a **client**) and that content is getting served to us from somewhere (as a **server**).
When we are on our device, we as a client make a **request** that I want to get this information, this request leave our **client-side device** and find itself all the way to a remote **server-side device** somewhere, that server can hear our requests and **respond** with something, via which our request gets served. This is the backbone of the Internet, in the most fundamental way, this is how the Internet works.

If I had a document and I want to open it on my computer, what will I do? I'd use some document viewer software (e.g. MS Word) on my computer. If PDF, some PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat). So, we have these tools/softwares, basically programs which are really good at opening certain types of files, while running on our client-side devices. Similarly, we have a program called **browser** in our computers (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge, Safari), which is really good at opening files like HTML, CSS, JS and through that we are able to see things on our computer screens. Via this browser on our client device, we are able to make a requests to a server, that server is just an another computer out there on the internet which can hear that request and has some program/code that tells it what to do. 

Let's take an example of a restaurant, you as a client can make requests from your table to the kitchen and the kitchen as a server/backend serves you the food as per your request. You don't really care about what's happening in the kitchen, you just care that the kitchen gives you the food. That's the exact same thing happening on the Internet, you as a client from your device are making requests, those requests go to some server and you get information back. The beautiful thing here is that all our devices have a program called browser and this browser can run the files which are being sent back from the server, so when we get the food served, there are some things that we can eat and there are some that we couldn't eat well. The server works the same way, the server can send you a file that the browser has no idea what to do with, but the browser can handle these HTML, CSS, JS files.

Now let's say, we want to order a pizza from dominoes, for that we type dominoes.com in the browser on our device, that request goes to a dominoes server and then they are going to respond with HTML, CSS & JS, these are actual individual files but they handle something different. Once the response comes back to our device, we can see a complete dominoes website. All the content we can see on that website is all powered by **HTML**, be it text, image etc. Now the content you see with different colors, sizes, positioning, alignments, style is all powered by **CSS**. Now on that website, you can click on buttons, drag things around, interact, this is all powered by **JavaScript**. This all stuff is happening on our client side, we are seeing all this on our device but there's a lot of stuff that has to happen on that server. They have to be able to process our credit cards for payments, they have to able to keep track of our order history, they have to be able to show us food items based on our selection, now all these things that we never see is happening on the server-side.

Now under the web development, there are different roles i.e. full stack developer, front-end developer, back-end developer. 
The people who just focus on the things that user sees are **client-side or front-end developers**, people who focuses on the things that happens behind the scene on the server are **server-side or back-end developers** and the people who can do both are **full-stack developers**.

We have come to know that this whole digital communication is about sending requests and getting responses, now interesting thing is that these requests & responses are going across real wires.

These wires enable our communication across the world.
