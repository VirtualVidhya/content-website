We've got familiar with the Internet now. Internet in these all wires, the whole system, the **web** is something that sits on top of this network.
When the internet first came out, there were different browsers, there was a browser war, the code you'd write for one browser wouldn't work for an another one. To solve this, there needs to be some standards so that the web will work for all, through which the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** was created, it's the body which governs and protect the rules for the web.

Currently we are on the fifth version of HTML i.e. **HTML5**

HTML - Content / Structure

CSS - Style

JavaScript - Behaviour / Interaction
