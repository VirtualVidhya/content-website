#### Q1.

Write a JS program to delete all occurrences of a given number in a given array.

for e.g.

```jsx
arr - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3]
num - 2

// output 
arr - [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]
// (See all 2's (num) are removed from array)
```

---

#### Q2. 

Print the factorial of a given number n.

(**NOTE:** Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a
given positive integer and denoted by that integer.)

for e.g.

```jsx
7! (factorial of 7) = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040
5! (factorial of 5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
3! (factorial of 3) = 3*2*1 = 6
(0! is always 1)
```

---

#### Q3. 

Find the largest number in a given array with only positive numbers.

for e.g.

```jsx
let nums = [23, 59, 17, 61, 34, 46, 8];

// output
largest number: 61
```

#### Q4. _(Adv.)_

Write a JS program to find the number of digits in a given number.

for e.g.

```jsx
let number = 287152;

// output
count: 6

number = 397

// output
count: 3
```

---

#### Q5. _(Adv.)_

Write a JS program to find the sum of digits in a given number.

(**NOTE:** The number of digits of a given number can be anything.)

for e.g.

```jsx
let number = 287152;

// output
sum: 25
(Which is sum of all digits of the given number 287152 [2 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 2])

number = 397;

// output
sum: 19
(3 + 9 + 7)
```
