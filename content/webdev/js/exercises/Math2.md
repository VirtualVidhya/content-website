#### Q1.

Create a program that generates a random number representing a dice roll.

(**NOTE:** The dice has 6 possible outcomes between 1 & 6 so the randomly generated number should be between 1 & 6).

---

#### Q2. _(Adv.)_

Create a program to choose a lucky winner of a contest.

[**HINT:** Assume you have a set of customers (their data in form of their name) and for a draw, you have to randomly select a lucky customer.]

expected output: 

```jsx
Lucky winner of the contest is `CustomerName`.
```

(**NOTE:** your program should be independent of the number of customers, means if the number of customers changes even then your program will work without changing anything inside your code.)
