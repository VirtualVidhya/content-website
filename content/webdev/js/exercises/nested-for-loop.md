#### Q1.

Let's say user is giving 2 numbers `n1` & `n2` as input.

Write a program to print the multiplication tables of all numbers between `n1` & `n2` one by one in order.

expected output:

```jsx
// n1 -> 4 & n2 -> 6

#table of 4
4
8
12
16
20
24
28
32
36
40
#table of 5
5
10
15
20
25
30
35
40
45
50
#table of 6
6
.
.
.
```

<!-- (**NOTE:** Your program should be flexible enough so that in case in future, if we want to print tables of numbers bw 4 & 15 then it can be updated very easily.) -->
