#### Q1.

Take password from user as input using `prompt`.

Now generally in practice, spaces aren’t allowed in password.

so remove unnecessary spaces from start and end, then store it, then print it for testing.

#### Q2.

Take email from user as input using `prompt`.

Now generally in practice, we prefer email to be in all small case.

so convert it into lowercase, also remove unnecessary spaces from start & end for safety (User might have added them by mistake), then store it, at last print it for testing.

#### Q3.

For the string:

`let str = “LetslearnJS”;`

predict the output of the following operations:

- `str.slice(4,9);`
- `str.indexOf(”ea”);`
- `str.replace(”JS”, ”CSS”);` 

(**NOTE:** you have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.)

#### Q4.

Separate the “Lets” part in above string ("LetsLearnJS") & replace 't' with 's' in it.

expected output:

```jsx
// LetsLearnJS --> Lets -->

Less
```
