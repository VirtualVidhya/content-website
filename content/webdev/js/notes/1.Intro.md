### Why Learn JavaScript Anyway?

Until now, we’ve built webpages with decent enough content structuring, formatting and styling using HTML & CSS.

But the nature of such pages is very static, what that means is that there’s no sense of interactivity or dynamic behavior on these pages. These static pages only serves the purpose of delivering content in a well formatted - styled form, just like a document.

so now…

To add any sort of logic to your website, make it more interactive, and also manipulate our HTML and CSS due to that logic, 

we need JavaScript.

Wherever you step, on the web development world, you’ll see the footprints of Javascript.
If you desire to be a web developer, then you just HAVE to be familiar with javascript.

But if you thought “cool” is the only feature of JavaScript, then you are wrong, 

because JavaScript is also relatively easy, and it’s the base of the most popular frameworks out there, such as angular.js, react.js, backbone.js, knockout, and even good old jQuery! 

### What is Javascript?

Here’s a person, called Bob.
Bob has eyes, ears, nose, mouth…
He has a body, and also some clothes…
But until it has a brain that functions everything together, it’s only a bunch of organs
connected to each other.
Just like that, you can surely know HTML and structure huge website.
You can also decorate and style your website, with CSS.
But, if you lack in your Javascript skills, your webpages will look dull and old.
Javascript is the programming language of the web. It is our functioning brain that keeps
everything in touch.
If you want your website to be more interactive, so your users could click on one element and
be amazed when it actually does something, be sure you have your Javascript skills well put
together.

Basically, JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites.
