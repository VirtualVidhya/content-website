With the help of navigation, we can go from one element to an another…

There are certain properties in navigation, with the help of which we can do our navigation…

- `parentElement`
- `children`
- `previousElementSibling` / `nextElementSibling`

For e.g. we have this code…

```jsx
<div>

	<h1></h1>
	
	<p></p>
	
</div>
```

We can form the relationship between elements here…

`div` → parent

`h1` & `p` → children

`h1` & `p` → sibling of each other

So, we have formed a hierarchical structure here, a similar structure gets formed inside our DOM.

With the help of this,

we can print a `parentElement` of any element.

 e.g. for `h1` & `p`, `div` will get printed as parentElement.

Every child will have a single parent.

Every parent may have multiple children.

In this case, `h4` has no children.

There’s an another property `childElementCount`,

which tells us that how many children does this element have?

We can change the styling of elements by navigating to them using these siblings as well.

Here, we haven’t directly accessed `h1`. We indirectly accessed it using its siblings.
