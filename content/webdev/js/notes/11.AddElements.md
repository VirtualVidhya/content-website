Until now, we have seen how to manipulate already existing elements on the page but one of the changes can be to add a whole new element on the page as well.

`document.createElement('p');`

Just by doing this, we won’t be able to see this new para neither on our page nor in our DOM (HTML elements tab in browser.)

If we print the details of our newPara, we will be able to see that all the properties are null.

Let’s try adding some text in this paragraph…

Now we can see that it’s innerText property is filled…

But this element is still not visible on our webpage.

Because, by creating this element it gets added in our DOM but to actually add it on our webpage we have to insert it on our webpage.

For that we have to use,

`obj.appendChild(element);`

What `appendChild` does is, in whichever object we want to insert an element in the form of nesting, it inserts there.

For e.g. if we want to add our para in the body…

append means to add at last, so `appendChild` adds an element at the end.

We can add an element inside an another element as well.

With the help of `appendChild`, we have appended a new element.

But we can append a new string/text as well.

`append` is useful in adding content/element inside the same element itself.

Just like `append`, we have `prepend` as well.

`append` adds at the end/last, `prepend` adds at the start/first.

We have an another method as well which is `insertAdjacentElement`, with the help of which we can tell exactly where we want to add an element.

`insertAdjacentElement(where, element);`

- `'beforebegin'`: Before the `targetElement` itself.
- `'afterbegin'`: Just inside the `targetElement`, before its first child.
- `'beforeend'`: Just inside the `targetElement`, after its last child.
- `'afterend'`: After the `targetElement` itself.

We’ve created a new button.

We’ve selected the about para.

With `beforebegin`, it has added before starting the para.

With `afterbegin`, it has added after starting the para, inside the para itself as a first child.
