Events are signals that some activity has occurred (user input/actions) on the webpage

## Inline Events

Here we have simply created a button in HTML. On that button we have used a inline event called `onclick` . Now we can assign whatever JS code we want to execute when that button is clicked to this `onclick` event.

Now whenever that button will be clicked, the `onclick` event will get triggered and this statement will be printed in the console.

We can assign multiple JS expressions to this `onclick` as well.

But…

**The inline way to handle the event triggers is not an efficient way.**

For e.g. let’s say we have a like button for a content on a social media app. Now we have so many pieces of content so there will be multiple like buttons.

Moreover there won’t be just like button for a content piece, there will be share, repost, comment etc. buttons for each piece of content.

Then if we keep doing inline event triggers then our code will become very bulky, messy, harder to manage and understand.

Therefore, it’s not advised to use inline event triggers but in some rare cases where the code base is very small then we can use inline event triggers there.
