Here, in button object we can see so many `on*`  events associated with it.

But when we try to print the value of `onclick` property for this button, we get null.

Because currently, no action has been assigned to it.

So we can assign a function to button’s `onclick` event in our JS file.

As soon as the button was clicked, the `onclick` even got triggered which triggered the function and then whatever was mentioned in the function, got performed.

We can assign `alert` to `onclick` as well.

We can create separate function as well and then assign its value to onclick event.

Let’s say we have multiple buttons and want to trigger the same action for them.

One important thing here is when we are assigning the function to the `onlick` event, we shouldn’t include parenthesis there.

like this,

Because what it will do is instead of assigning the function value to the event, it will execute the function itself there.

What we need to do is not to execute the function but assign the value of the function (i.e. just give the function name to the event).

There are so many DOM events, we don’t need to remember each and every one of them but there are some important ones which gets used very often. We will check them out.

## onmouseenter

Whenever our mouse cursor (pointer) enters into the area covered by the element on the webpage then this event gets triggered. (In short, whenever we hover the mouse pointer over the element.)
