When `this` is used in a callback of event handler of something, then it refers to that something.

What does it mean?

When we create an event listener (handler) for an object, we have 2 things, event & callback. We can use `this` in the callback and the significance of `this` in the callback will be that specific object for which the event listener has been created.

Here, `this` refers to the `button` on which the event listener has been added.

We can access other properties of the button object using `this` as well.

Here, we have different HTML elements.

Now what we want is whatever element of the webpage is hovered, its background-color should get changed to red.

For it, we can select each and every element individually and add listener to each one of them.

But this isnâ€™t a good way to write a code,

Because we are repeating similar lines of code again & again.

We can do this instead because we know that meaning of `this` in event callback is the object on which the event listener has been added to.
