Until now, all the events we have seen are mouse related events.

We can have keyboard input related events as well.

Before we learn about keyboard events,

let’s see something about a special default argument which is `event` argument, we have it as an automatic argument in callbacks.

This `event` argument gives us a lot of information about the triggered event.

We will use this default `event` arg a lot for keyboard events.

This `keydown` event gets triggered when any keyboard key (all the letters, enter, shift, tab, arrow keys) gets down pressed.

Similarly we can use `keyup` for when the pressed key is released.

The important parameters (properties) we need to focus on are `code` and `key`.

- `code`: It gives us the actual code of that key
- `key`: It gives us what got visible on the screen via that key

This is very useful to detect which key input has been given.

**IMPORTANT** to note here is that,

If you want to use these key events on & for specific HTML elements, it’ll work only with focusable elements i.e. `input`, `textarea`

So if we want to detect any key inputs, across the whole page then we can use key events using listener on the whole `document` object itself.
