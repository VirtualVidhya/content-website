Until now we have created HTML forms, but we were wondering that where is this data even going?!

Now finally, we will learn to extract (get/access) this form data.

We won’t get whatever is entered inside input using `innerText` because `innerText` gives us what is written on the page internally via HTML, it won’t be able to give us something entered externally.

But we can see here in the `input` object’s `value` property. It is showing us the value entered inside the input field.

Instead of selecting form elements by `id`, we can use internal property called `elements` of form itself, it’s a collection of all the elements created inside form.

We can get these values and then store them in a backend database.
