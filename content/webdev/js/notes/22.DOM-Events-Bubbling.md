For e.g.

We have a HTML here consisting of a `div` with nested `ul` having nested `li` elements.

In JS, we have given click event listener with console message on all of these elements.

Now when we will click the 

- yellow region → `'div was clicked'`

- orange region → `'ul was clicked'`
    
                            → `'div was clicked'`
    
- red region → `'li was clicked'`
    
                      → `'ul was clicked'`
    
                → `'div was clicked'`
    

So, the events on nested elements automatically trigger the events of their parents’ and subsequent parents’ events as well.

This behaviour itself is called Event Bubbling.

Because of this we can get undesirable changes on the page.

But we can stop this behaviour, using `stopPropagation()`

What it means is to stop this propagation (bubbling)
