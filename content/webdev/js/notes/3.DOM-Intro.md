Until now, we have covered all the fundamentals of a general programming language with JavaScript.

But now, we will delve into actual JavaScript programming for Web where we will learn to manipulate our HTML & CSS via JavaScript.

For that we first need to understand a very important concept called DOM (Document Object Model).

DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

What it means is DOM keeps a logical representation of the structure of HTML & CSS elements (hierarchical parent-child structure of different elements),

which allows us to manipulate/change webpage content (which consists of HTML & CSS elements).

Let’s say we have a basic HTML structure

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Web Development</h1>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
</body>
```

Now when we will link this HTML + CSS files with JS, then it will make a logical tree structure

![window object](../../../../images/notes/DOM-Intro/1.png)

Each of these circles of a tree (structure) is called ‘node’ in programming language.

All of these nodes become objects in JS.

So, when we want to make any changes to let’s say `div` then in JS, we will make changes to it by accessing this `div` object.

Now, what is this `document` object?

We know about the in-built `window` object of JS, which is auto-generated & always available.

![document object](../../../../images/notes/DOM-Intro/2.png)

Now similarly, for every object a `document` object gets automatically generated by JS.

![console.dir](../../../../images/notes/DOM-Intro/3.png)

If we expand that object, it simply looks like a HTML code but actually it’s not HTML code, it’s a `document` object which was generated by JS. This `document` object stores all the details about our HTML & CSS.

Now we can also print different properties of this `document` object. For it, we don’t use regular `console.log()`, we use `console.dir()`.

![DOM Logical Tree](../../../../images/notes/DOM-Intro/dom-diagram.png)

It contains so many properties and other objects as well like `body`.

Now when we make changes to this `document` object’s properties then our webpage actually make changes so when we want to manipulate our HTML & CSS then we will use `document` object.
