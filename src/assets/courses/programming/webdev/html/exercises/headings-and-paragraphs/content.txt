The Story of HTML: From Birth to Modern Web
This page explores the origin, history, and evolution of HTML, using headings and paragraphs to organize information clearly for practice.

Origins of HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It was designed to share scientific documents among researchers using hyperlinks to navigate between pages.

The first version of HTML was simple, with just a few tags for headings, paragraphs, links, and lists. Its goal was to make documents easily readable on different computers.

Early Development and Milestones
HTML 2.0 (1995)
HTML 2.0 became the first standardized specification published by the IETF. It formalized tags for forms, tables, and other common elements, setting the foundation for future growth.

HTML 3.2 & 4.0 (1997-1999)
HTML 3.2 introduced support for applets, text flow around images, and more formatting options. HTML 4.0 added separation of structure and presentation through CSS, emphasizing accessibility and internationalization.

Evolution into HTML5
Work on HTML5 began in 2004, aiming to replace both HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0. It added semantic elements like <article>, <section>, and <nav>, as well as multimedia support without plugins.

HTML5 introduced APIs for canvas drawing, web storage, geolocation, and more, enabling rich web applications directly in the browser.

HTML Today and Beyond
Modern web standards continue to refine HTML. Browsers and communities collaborate through the W3C and WHATWG to evolve the language, focusing on performance, accessibility, and new capabilities.

As you practice, consider how headings and paragraphs help structure content logicallyâ€”just as HTML itself structures the web.
