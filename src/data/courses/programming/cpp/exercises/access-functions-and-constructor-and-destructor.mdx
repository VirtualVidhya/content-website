#### Q1.

A bank wants to manage customer accounts efficiently.

Create a program that:

- Store an account holder's name, account number, and balance.
- Allow depositing and withdrawing money.
- Prevent withdrawals if the balance is insufficient.
- Display the account details.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Create a class for BankAccount to store:
    - Account Holder's Name (e.g., Ramesh Panipuriwala)
    - Account Number (e.g., 78563249)
    - Balance (e.g., rs.50000)

- Implement member functions to: 
    - Set account details. 
    - Deposit money into the account. 
    - Withdraw money (if there is enough balance). 
    - Display the account details.

#### Q4.

A Smart Thermostat is installed in a home to maintain a comfortable and safe room temperature.

- The temperature should always stay within a reasonable limit to ensure comfort and efficiency (i.e. 10Â°C to 40Â°C).
- Users can check the current temperature and set a new one.
- If the user tries to set a temperature outside the allowed range, the system should automatically adjust it to the nearest valid temperature and warn the user.
- The thermostat should indicate whether heating or cooling is active based on the following logic:
  - If the temperature is below 20Â°C, Heating mode should turn ON.
  - If the temperature is above 30Â°C, Cooling mode should turn ON.
  - If the temperature is between 20Â°C and 30Â°C, the room is comfortable, so no heating or cooling is required.
- The users can get useful information from thermostat, such as:
  - The current temperature.
  - Whether heating or cooling is required based on the set temperature.
  - The energy-saving mode status, which activates if the temperature is within an efficient range.

#### Q6.

A Smart Car Energy Management System is designed to optimize battery usage and adjust driving modes for efficient performance.

- The battery level should always remain between 0% and 100%.
- The system should display warnings when the battery is low (below 15%) and prevent driving when the battery is at 0%.
- The car can also boost the battery, but the level cannot exceed 100%.
- Users can manually switch the drive mode:
  - Sport Mode requires at least 50% battery. It cannot be activated if the battery is below this threshold.
  - If the battery level drops below 30%, the system automatically switches to Eco Mode unless manually overridden. The user can only override it to 
  Normal Mode (not Sport Mode).
  - Normal Mode has no specific battery requirements, meaning it can be set at any battery level.
- Users can get useful information from the system, such as:
  - The current drive mode.
  - The current battery level.
  - The car's status (e.g., low battery warning or driving condition).

#### Q8.

A text editor should ensure that users do not lose their progress, whether they manually save or forget to do so. The system should always create a backup in case of an unexpected shutdown.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
Design a TextEditor class that manages a document's lifecycle. The system should:

- Display a message when a new document is created.
- Allow the user to write and edit the document.
- Provide an option to manually exit the editor.
- When exiting, prompt the user to save manually or not.
  - If the user chooses to save, save the document normally.
  - If the user chooses not to save, still create a backup save for safety.
- If the program closes unexpectedly, the destructor should automatically perform a backup save to prevent data loss.

#### Q9.

A Vending Machine allows users to insert money, select a product, and receive change. However, if a user inserts money but does not select a product, the machine should automatically return the money when the session ends (e.g., due to inactivity or power failure). This ensures that no money remains stuck in the machine.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
Create a VendingMachine class that allows users to:

- Insert money into the machine.
- Select a product (if enough money is inserted).
- Dispense the product and return any change.
- Automatically return the money if the user does not select a product before exiting or if the machine shuts down unexpectedly.
