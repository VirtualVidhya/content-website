#### Q2.

At a local bank, customers are allowed to withdraw money without any extra charge as long as the withdrawal amount is less than rs.1000 in a single day.
However, if a customer withdraws rs.1000 or more in a day, a small transaction fee is applied.
Write a program that asks the customer how much money they want to withdraw today and based on the amount, 
tells them whether a transaction fee will be applied or not.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// case 1[0m
Enter withdrawal amount: 750   [2;3m// user input[0m
A transaction fee will not be applied.

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Enter withdrawal amount: 2650   [2;3m// user input[0m
A transaction fee will be applied.
```

#### Q6.

At the airport cargo counter, packages are checked based on their size. Instead of actual weight, they use a volumetric weight formula to decide if 
the package is too heavy to ship. Write a program that ask the user to enter the length, breadth, and height of the package in cm, then calculate 
the volumetric weight in kg and finally tells if the package is accepted for shipping or not.
  
- The formula is: `Volumetric Weight = (Length x Breadth x Height) / 5000`
- If the package's volumetric weight is more than 20 kg then it's considered too heavy for air shipping.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// case 1[0m
Enter the length of the package (in cm): 40   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the breadth of the package (in cm): 30   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the height of the package (in cm): 20   [2;3m// user input[0m

Volumetric weight: 4.8 kg  
Package accepted for shipping.

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Enter the length of the package (in cm): 100   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the breadth of the package (in cm): 80   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the height of the package (in cm): 50   [2;3m// user input[0m

Volumetric weight: 80.0 kg  
Package too heavy for air shipping!

#### Q9.

At the college library, books can be borrowed and returned by students. To manage everything efficiently, they need a system to check students' borrowing history and pending dues.
Write a program that,

- Asks the user if they have borrowed any book or not.
- If they haven't borrowed any book, they are immediately allowed to borrow a new one.
- If they have borrowed a book, the system then asks how many days it has been since they borrowed it.
    - If the number of days is 14 or less, they are allowed to borrow another book.
    - If the number of days is more than 14, they are told the number of overdue days and asked to pay a fine of rs.1 per day before they can borrow a new book.

Write a program for this.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// case 1[0m
Did you borrow any book previously? (yes/no): no   [2;3m// user input[0m
You can borrow a new book. No pending returns.

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Did you borrow any book previously? (yes/no): yes   [2;3m// user input[0m
How many days ago did you borrow the book?: 10   [2;3m// user input[0m
Book returned within allowed time. You can borrow a new book.

[2;3m// case 3[0m
Did you borrow any book previously? (yes/no): yes   [2;3m// user input[0m
How many days ago did you borrow the book?: 20   [2;3m// user input[0m
Your book return is overdue. You have a pending fine of rs.6.
Please clear the fine before borrowing a new book.

#### Q13.

At a city's traffic control system, drivers are monitored for speed violations. The city has a strict speed policy - if a driver stays within the 
speed limit, they can continue without any fine. However, if they exceed the limit, fines are imposed depending on how much they overspeed.

Write a program that asks the driver for their current speed and informs them if they are safe or what fine they need to pay.

- If the speed is 60 km/h or below, no fine is issued.
- If the speed is between 61 and 80 km/h, a fine of rs.500 is issued.
- If the speed is above 80 km/h, a fine of rs.1000 is issued.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// case 1[0m
Enter your current speed (in km/h): 75   [2;3m// user input[0m
You have exceeded the speed limit. A fine of rs.500 is applicable.

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Enter your current speed (in km/h): 95   [2;3m// user input[0m
You have exceeded the speed limit. A fine of rs.1000 is applicable.
```

#### Q14.

Consider the following program:

    if (x >= 0)
        if (x <= 20)
            std::cout << x << " is between 0 and 20\n";
        else
            std::cout << x << " is negative\n";

    return 0;
}
```

#### Q17. _**(Adv.)**_

At the city's electricity board, household electricity bills are calculated based on the number of units consumed in a month. The board follows a slab system where different rates apply based on consumption levels.

Write a program that asks the user to enter the total number of electricity units consumed for the month, then calculates and displays the final bill amount according to the following rules:

- For the first 100 units, the charge is rs.3 per unit.
- For the next 100 units (units 101 to 200), the charge is rs.4 per unit.
- For any units beyond 200, the charge is rs.5 per unit.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// case 1[0m
Enter total electricity units consumed: 150   [2;3m// user input[0m
Electricity Bill: rs.500

[2;3m// First 100 units: 100 x rs.3 = rs.300, Next 50 units: 50 x rs.4 = rs.200
// Total = rs.300 + rs.200 = rs.500

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Enter total electricity units consumed: 250   [2;3m// user input[0m
Electricity Bill: rs.950

[2;3m// First 100 units: 100 x rs.3 = rs.300, Next 100 units: 100 x rs.4 = rs.400
// Remaining 50 units: 50 x rs.5 = rs.250
// Total = rs.300 + rs.400 + rs.250 = rs.950
```

#### Q18.

At an international airport's travel help desk, travellers often want to know the value of their Indian Rupees (INR) in different currencies.
Write a program that helps a traveller by converting their amount in INR into a currency of their choice.

- Ask the traveller to enter the amount in INR.
- Then, ask which currency they want to convert to by selecting an option:
    - 1 - US Dollar (USD)
    - 2 - Euro (EUR)
    - 3 - British Pound (GBP)
    - 4 - Chinese Yuan (CNY)
    - 5 - Russian Ruble (RUB)

- Based on their selection, display the converted amount. Use the following fixed conversion rates:
    - 1 INR = 0.012 USD
    - 1 INR = 0.011 EUR
    - 1 INR = 0.0095 GBP
    - 1 INR = 0.087 CNY
    - 1 INR = 0.98 RUB

**Expected Output**

```ansi
Enter the amount in INR: 7000   [2;3m// user input[0m

Select the currency to convert to:
1 - US Dollar (USD)
2 - Euro (EUR)
3 - British Pound (GBP)
4 - Chinese Yuan (CNY)
5 - Russian Ruble (RUB)

Your choice (1-5): 2   [2;3m// user input[0m

Converted amount: 77 EUR
```
