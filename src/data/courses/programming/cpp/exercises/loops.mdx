#### Q9.

<LinkMd href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" title="Fizz Buzz" /> is a simple math game used to teach children about divisibility. It is also sometimes used as an interview question to assess basic programming skills.
The rules of the game are simple: Starting at 1, and counting upward, replace any number divisible only by three with the word ‚Äúfizz‚Äù, any number only divisible by five with the word ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù, and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word ‚Äúfizzbuzz‚Äù.)

Take 2 numbers as user input and then print all the numbers starting from first given number, incrementing one by one, to second given number at last, but for any number divisible only by 3 print the word ‚Äúfizz‚Äù, any number only divisible by 5 print the word ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 print the word ‚Äúfizzbuzz‚Äù.

#### Q14. _**(Adv.)**_

A popular music festival is happening in town, and the organizer has invited `N` different bands to perform on the main stage. Since the event has only one stage, 
the performances will happen one after the other ‚Äî no two bands can perform at the same time.

Now, the organizer wants to explore all the possible ways these bands could be scheduled throughout the day. This is important because the sequence in which the bands 
perform can impact the audience experience, energy levels, and crowd engagement.

For example, should the high-energy band go first, or last? Should the acoustic group follow the rock band, or should they go earlier? To make these decisions wisely, 
the organizer first wants to know:
‚ÄúIn how many different ways can I arrange the performance order for today's bands?‚Äù

Write a program that:

- Asks the organizer about how many bands are performing today?
- Calculates and displays the total number of possible lineups (schedules).

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
 [2;3m// case 1[0m
Enter the number of bands:: 4   [2;3m// user input[0m

Total possible lineups: 24

[2;3m// case 2[0m
Enter the number of bands:: 6   [2;3m// user input[0m

Total possible lineups: 720

#### Q15.

A new caf√© wants a big, eye-catching sign around its name. To help them, write a program that asks the user for the width and 
height of the sign, then draw a rectangular border of * characters of that size. The inside should be blank.

```ansi
Enter width: 10   [2;3m// user input[0m

#### Q16.

At an event entrance, the staff record the ages of attendees. The survey wants to know how many are minors (< 18) and how many are adults (‚â• 18). 
Write a program that:

- That first asks for the number of attendees to survey and then asks for each attendee's age.
- Keeps counts of both minors and adults.
- Displays both counts at the end.

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">

#### Q17.

A coach wants a quick strike-rate report for every batsman in a small squad, each facing a fixed number of balls. To solve this problem, 
write a program that:

- Asks how many batsmen are there in the squad.
- Asks how many balls each batsman faced.
- For each batsman, asks how many runs they scored on each ball.
- Then calculates and prints, the total runs scored and the strike rate for each batsman (Runs/Balls * 100).

    `batting strike-rate = (total runs scored / total balls faced) * 100`

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">

#### Q18. _**(Adv.)**_

{/* A fruit wholesaler uses two suppliers on different schedules. Supplier-1 delivers `A` apple crates every `X` days and Supplier-2 delivers `B` orange crates every `Y` days. */}
{/* A fruit wholesaler receives apple and orange crates on regular schedules. Shipments of apples arrive every `X` days and oranges arrive every `Y` days.  */}
{/* Each time both shipments arrive on the same day, the wholesaler wants to pack mixed fruit baskets using all crates from that day's delivery, without leaving any leftover. */}
{/* Whenever both apple and orange trucks arrive on the same day, the wholesaler wants to unpack that day's full delivery and pack mixed baskets so that: - Each basket contains the same number of apple and orange crates. - No crates are left over from that day's delivery. */}

A fruit wholesaler receives apple crates every `X` days and orange crates every `Y` days. Each apple delivery brings `A` crates and each orange delivery brings `B` crates. 
The wholesaler stores all incoming crates and wants to pack mixed baskets so that every basket has the same number of apple and orange crates, using up the entire stock 
on one of the pack-days.

{/* To prepare for this, the wholesaler needs to know: - The largest number of apple and orange crates per basket so that each basket has the same number of crates for each fruit and none go unused. - The number of days after which both apple and orange trucks will arrive together again. */}

To solve the fruit wholesaler's problem, write a program that asks the user to enter:
- Days between apple deliveries - `X`
- Number of apple crates per delivery - `A`
- Days between orange deliveries - `Y`
- Number of orange crates per delivery - `B`
{/* write a program that asks for the two delivery intervals (in days) - `X` for apples and `Y` for oranges,  */}
Then calculate and display:
- The maximum crates per basket (the largest equal number of apple and orange crates you can pack into each basket without leftovers).
- The days until the next full pack-day (after how many days the wholesaler will have exactly matching totals of stored apples and oranges to pack into those baskets).
{/* - The maximum number of crates of each fruit that fit into one mixed basket without leftovers. The number of days until the next time both shipments arrive on the same day. */}
