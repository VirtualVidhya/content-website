#### Q6.

<LinkMd href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" title="Fizz Buzz" /> is a simple math game used to teach children about divisibility. It is also sometimes used as an interview question to assess basic programming skills.
The rules of the game are simple: Starting at 1, and counting upward, replace any number divisible only by three with the word ‚Äúfizz‚Äù, any number only divisible by five with the word ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù, and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word ‚Äúfizzbuzz‚Äù.)

Take 2 numbers as user input and then print all the numbers starting from first given number, incrementing one by one, to second given number at last, but for any number divisible only by 3 print the word ‚Äúfizz‚Äù, any number only divisible by 5 print the word ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 print the word ‚Äúfizzbuzz‚Äù.

#### Q9.

Take 10 numbers as input from user one by one and then give the sum of all the numbers the user entered. 
The user can stop the asking loop at any point by entering 0 as an input, in that case, give the sum of all numbers the user
has entered upto that point.

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
Enter a number to add, or 0 to exit: 5   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter a number to add, or 0 to exit: 2   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter a number to add, or 0 to exit: 1   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter a number to add, or 0 to exit: 0   [2;3m// user input[0m

The sum of all the numbers you entered is: 8
[2;3m// 5 + 2 + 1 = 8
```

#### Q10.

Create a "Guess the Lucky Number" game in C++.

As the admin, set a "lucky number" between 1 and 100 in the program. The user (player) will attempt to guess this number.

<div>
The program should repeatedly prompt the user for a guess until they either:
    <ul>
        <li>Correctly match the lucky number.</li>
        <li>Enter 0 to exit the game (at any time).</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
To help the player, provide hints after each guess:
    <ul>
        <li>If the guess is larger than the lucky number, display a message indicating it is too high.</li>
        <li>If the guess is smaller, indicate it is too low.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

This feedback allows the player to narrow down their guesses and find the lucky number.

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
[2;3m// lucky number: 25[0m

Guess the lucky number: 87   [2;3m// user input[0m
Your guessed number is larger than the lucky number. Try Again.   [2;3m// hint[0m

Guess the lucky number: 17   [2;3m// user input[0m
Your guessed number is smaller than the lucky number. Try Again.

Guess the lucky number: 45   [2;3m// user input[0m
Your guessed number is larger than the lucky number. Try Again.

Guess the lucky number: 25   [2;3m// user input[0m
Congratulations, you have guessed the lucky number.
