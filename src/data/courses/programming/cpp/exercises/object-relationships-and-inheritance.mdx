#### Q1.

- Create a Fruit base class that contains two private members: a name (`std::string`), and a color (`std::string`). 
- Create an Apple class that inherits Fruit. Apple should have an additional private member: fiber (`double`). 
- Create a Banana class that also inherits Fruit. Banana has no additional members.

The following program should run:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	Apple a{ "Red delicious", "red", 4.2 };
	std::cout << a.printDetails() << '\n';

	Banana b{ "Cavendish", "yellow" };
	std::cout << b.printDetails() << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

And print the following:

```ansi
Apple(Red delicious, red, 4.2)
Banana(Cavendish, yellow)
```

---

#### Q2.

- Create a Carriage class that contains three private members: an id (`int`), a type (`std::string`) and a seatCount (`int`).
- Create a Train class that contains two private members: a name (`std::string`) and carriages (`std::vector<Carriage>`) should have:
    - a constructor taking the train name,
    - an `addCarriage(`const std::string& type, int seats)` method that automatically assigns `id = carriages.size() + 1` and adds a new Carriage,
    - a `printManifest()` method that returns a `std::string` listing the train name and each carriage's specs.

And print the following:

```ansi
Train: Rajdhani Express
Carriage[1: Sleeper, 40 seats]
Carriage[2: Seater, 72 seats]
Carriage[3: Dining, 20 seats]
```

#### Q5.

A zoo wants to keep a registry of animals, organizing shared and unique information.

Create a program that:
- Stores common animal attributes: name, species, and age.
- For mammals, stores fur color and whether the animal is endangered.
- For birds, stores wing span (in cm) and whether the bird can fly.
- Allows displaying full details for any animal.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Create a base class `Animal` to store:
    - Name (e.g. “Sher Khan”)
    - Species (e.g. “Bengal Tiger”)
    - Age (e.g. 4)
    - Member functions to:
        - Display common media details.
- Create a derived class `Mammal` that inherits from Animal and adds:
    - Fur Color (e.g. “Orange with Black Stripes”)
    - Is Endangered? (e.g. true/false)
    - Member functions to:
        - Display all common details plus additional details - fur color and endangered status.
- Create another derived class `Bird` that inherits from `Animal` and adds:
    - Wing Span (in cm, e.g. 120)
    - Can Fly? (e.g. true/false)
    - Member functions to:
        - Display all common details plus additional details - wing span and flight capability.
- In `main()`, demonstrate:
    - Creating one `Mammal` object (e.g. a tiger) and one `Bird` object (e.g. a penguin).
    - Setting all relevant details.
    - Displaying each animal's full details.
</CollapsibleSection>

<div class="w-full my-2"></div>

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
[2;3m// Mammal details:[0m
Animal Details (Mammal):
Name: Sher Khan
Species: Bengal Tiger

#### Q7.

A computer shop needs a simple tool to keep track of each machine and its parts.

Create a program that:
- Keeps common computer info: brand and model name.
- For the CPU processor, stores number of cores and clock speed in GHz.
- For memory, lets you add multiple modules, each with a size in GB and a type chosen from a fixed list (for e.g. “DDR3”, “DDR4”, “DDR5”).
- Can show all the details of a computer in one formatted display.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
In your design you should:
- Have a Computer class that holds its brand, model, one CPU and a list of MemoryModules.
- Have a CPU class that stores its core count and clock speed.
- Have a MemoryModule class that stores its capacity and a type chosen from a predefined set of memory types (use an enum for the types).
- Let Computer provide a way to add memory modules.
- Provide a way to print everything: the computer's brand and model, the CPU's specs and each memory module's size and type.
- In `main()`, demonstrate by:
    - Creating a computer (pick any brand and model).
    - Adding at least two memory modules of different sizes/types.
    - Printing the computer's full details.

#### Q8.

- #### I.

Write an Apple class and a Banana class that are derived from a common Fruit class. Fruit should have two members: a name and a color.

The following program should run:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Apple a{ "red" };
	Banana b{};

	std::cout << "My " << a.getName() << " is " << a.getColor() << ".\n";
	std::cout << "My " << b.getName() << " is " << b.getColor() << ".\n";

	return 0;
}
```

And produce the result:

```ansi
My apple is red.
My banana is yellow.
```

- #### II.

Add a new class to the previous program called GrannySmith that inherits from Apple.

The following program should run:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Apple a{ "red" };
	Banana b;
	GrannySmith c;

	std::cout << "My " << a.getName() << " is " << a.getColor() << ".\n";
	std::cout << "My " << b.getName() << " is " << b.getColor() << ".\n";
	std::cout << "My " << c.getName() << " is " << c.getColor() << ".\n";

	return 0;
}
```

And produce the result:

```ansi
My apple is red.
My banana is yellow.
My Granny Smith apple is green.
```

#### Q10.

An e-learning platform wants to manage different types of courses (SelfPaced and LiveSession) using shared and unique information. 
Each course must enforce invariants (no negative prices or durations) and support behaviors like enrolling students, tracking progress, or 
scheduling sessions.

Create a program that:
- Stores common course attributes: course title, course ID and price.
- For self-paced courses, stores total video hours and number of modules, and provides functions to mark modules complete and calculate percentage progress.
- For live session courses, stores a scheduled date, maximum class size, and number of enrolled students, and provides functions to enroll a student 
(updating count until max) and check if the course is full.
- Enforces invariants: any negative price, video hours, modules, class size or enrolled count become zero; if enrolled count exceeds max, clamp to max.
- Allows displaying full details for any course, as well as calling its specific behaviors.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Create a base class `Course` to store:
    - Course Title (e.g. “Intro to C++”)
    - Course ID (e.g. “CSE101”)
    - Price (in ruppees, e.g. 15000.00)
    - Member functions to:
        - Display common course details.
- Create a derived class `SelfPacedCourse` that inherits from Course and adds:
    - Total Video Hours (e.g. 10.5)
    - Number of Modules (e.g. 8)
    - Completed Modules (initially 0)
    - Member functions to:
        - Mark a module as completed, which increments the completed modules count, up to the total number of modules.
        - To know the progress percentage.
        - Display all the course details.
    - Getter and Setter functions for Total Video Hours and Number of Modules.
- Create a derived class `LiveSessionCourse` that inherits from Course and adds:
    - Course Duration (in months, e.g. 3)
    - Max Class Size (e.g. 30)
    - Enrolled Students (initially 0)
    - Member functions to:
        - Enroll a student, which increments the enrolled students count, up to the max class size.
        - To check if the class is full.
        - Display all the course details.
    - Getter and Setter functions for Course Duration.
- In `main()`, demonstrate:
    - Creating one `SelfPacedCourse` object, setting valid relevant details.
    - Display all the course details for it.
    - For `SelfPacedCourse` object, call complete module function several times and print the progress percent after each to show how progress increases.
    - Use the relevant access function to change the video hours of one course, then display the course details again to confirm the update.
    - Attempt to call complete module function enough times to exceed the total number of modules, and show that completed modules count 
    never goes past its maximum.
    - Creating one `LiveSessionCourse` object, setting valid relevant details.
    - Display all the course details for it.
    - For `LiveSessionCourse` object, repeatedly call enroll student function, until the class is full and then attempt to enroll one more student
    to verify that enrollment is blocked when at capacity.
    - Finally, create one `SelfPacedCourse` and one `LiveSessionCourse` each with invalid inputs 
    (e.g., empty title or ID, negative price, negative video hours, negative modules, negative class size, or enrolled > max).
    - Displaying each course's full details.
    - Display all the course details for each to show how invalid values were replaced by defaults, verifying that class invariants work as intended.

#### Q11. **_(Adv.)_**

An online marketplace sells a wide variety of items, from physical goods to digital downloads. Each product shares some common information, 
but extends into different details and behaviors depending on its type. So the store manager needs a tool that helps him maintain a unified 
catalog of all products, check whether an item can be sold (based on stock or valid license) and process orders accordingly.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- **Catalog Management**
    - Your program should allow the manager to add new products to the catalog, specifying:
        - Common fields:
            - product ID (e.g. "P1001" or "D2001")
            - product name (e.g. "Wireless Mouse" or "C++ eBook")
            - unit price (e.g. 25.00)
        - If it's a physical good: 
            - shipping weight in kg (e.g. 0.2)
            - dimensions (length x width x height in cm, e.g. 10 x 5 x 3)
            - initial stock count (e.g. 50)
        - If it's a digital download: 
            - file size in MB (e.g. 5)
            - full download URL (e.g. "example.com/download/ebook") 
            - license validity date (in dd/mm/yyyy format, e.g. 31-12-2025)
    - After adding items, the manager can ask the program to display all products, which prints every product's full information.
- **Availability Checking & Ordering**
    - When a customer tries to order some quantity of a product (physical or digital), the program must:
        - Look up the product by ID.
        - If it's a physical good:
            - Verify that the requested quantity is not more than the current stock.
            - If not enough stock, print an "Out of stock" or "Insufficient stock" message and decline the order.
            - If enough stock, calculate `shipping cost = (weight x shipping - rate) x quantity`. Use a fixed shipping rate of rs.5 per kg.
            - Reduce the product's stock by the purchased quantity.
            - Print an order summary showing product name, quantity, unit price, shipping cost (breakdown per unit and total), total cost and the 
            updated stock remaining.
        - If it's a digital download:
            - Check today's date (for e.g. assume the system date is "02-06-2025") against the license validity date.
            - If today is after the license expiry date, decline the order with "License expired" or "Download not available."
            - If the license is still valid, do not change any stock (digital items do not run out), but print an order summary showing product name, 
            quantity, unit price, total cost and the download URL.
- **User Interaction Workflow**
    - Add at least one physical product and one digital product to your catalog.
    - Display all products once after adding them.
    - Attempt these orders in sequence:
        - Order 2 units of the physical product.
        - Order 1 copy of the digital product.
        - Attempt to order more units of the physical product than remain in stock (to show the "insufficient stock" message).
        - Attempt to order the digital product again after the license has expired (to show the "License expired" message).
    - After each attempt, print the program's response or order summary.
    - At the very end, display all products again so the manager sees updated stock for the physical good.
