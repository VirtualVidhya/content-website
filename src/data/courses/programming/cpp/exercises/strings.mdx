    You have to predict the output result without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>

- #### I.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter your full name: ";
    std::string name;
    std::cin >> name;

    std::cout << "Enter your favorite color: ";
    std::string color;
    std::cin >> color;

    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " and your favorite color is " << color << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Input Test Cases:**

```ansi
[2;3m// #1[0m
name: Lagan
color: black

[2;3m// #2[0m
name: Lagan Khelaiya
color: black
```

- #### II.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;

    std::cout << "Now enter your name: ";
    std::string name;
    std::getline(std::cin, name);

    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << ", you entered " << number << ".\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**Input Test Cases:**

```ansi
[2;3m// #1[0m
number: 98
name: Magan

[2;3m// #2[0m
number: 98
name: Magan Chhapri
```

- #### III.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{

    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, name);

    std::cout << "Enter your favorite color: ";
    std::string color;
    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, color);

    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " and your favorite color is " << color << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

**Input Test Cases:**

#### Q2.

Write a program that asks the user to enter their full name and their age. As output, tell the user the sum of their age and the number of characters in their name.

<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    For simplicity, count any spaces in the name as a character.

```ansi
Enter your full name: Magan Chhapri
Enter your age: 32

Magan Chhapri's age + length of name is: 40
```
