- ## Task

Build a text-based Full-Year Calendar Generator, which based on a user-specified year, prints all twelve months with correctly 
aligned weekday headings and dates.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Prompt the user for the year (e.g. 2025).
- Before printing the calendar, you'd need to determine the first day of the week for January 1st of the given year.
    - Use the simplified version of <LinkMd href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence' title="Zeller's congruence algorithm" /> to 
    determine that:

        `first_day = ((Y-1) + (Y-1)//4  - (Y-1)//100  + (Y-1)//400  + 1) % 7`

        - Where `Y` is the year
        - All divisions here are <LinkMd href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/integer-division" title='integer divisions' /> `//`,
        discarding any remainder
        - The result gives the day of the week for January 1st of the given year as an integer value, where 0 - Sunday â€¦ 6 - Saturday

- Determine the day of the week for the first day of subsequent months:
    
    `first_day_of_next_month = (first_day_of_previous_month + days_in_month(m, y)) % 7`

    - Where `days_in_month(m, y)` is the number of days in month `m` of year `y`
    - The result gives the weekday index for the first day of the next month as an integer value, where 0 - Sunday â€¦ 6 - Saturday

- Print each month with the correct number of days and align the dates under the appropriate weekday headers (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat).
- Handle the varying number of days in each month and correctly align the dates under the weekday headers.
- Consider <LinkMd href='https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html' title="leap years" /> when determining the number of days in February.
- Ensure that the calendar is properly formatted and visually appealing.
