- ## Task

Build a text-based Hangman game where the player first selects a word category (e.g., Animals, Countries, Fruits etc.). The program then picks 
a random word from a pre-defined set of words for that category and the player guesses it one letter at a time. After each wrong guess, display an 
ASCII-art stick figure that progresses toward a full figure (i.e. hangman). The game ends when the player either uncovers the entire word or the 
stick figure is fully uncovered i.e. "hung".

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Let the player choose from a few word categories.
- The program secretly picks one word at random from the chosen category.
- Display the word as underscores (one for each letter).
- Each turn the player guesses a single letter; correct letters are revealed in place.
- Track wrong guesses and, after each miss, add one part to the ASCII-art hangman.
- Always show: the current word state, letters guessed so far, and the evolving hangman drawing.
- The player wins by uncovering the entire word before the hangman is complete; loses if the figure is finished first.
- ASCII Art Example:
```ansi
Initial Stage:
  +---+
  |   |
      |
      |
      |
      |
=========

Final Stage:
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
 / \  |
      |
=========
```

- The parts of this stick figure (i.e. head, body, left-right arm, left-right leg) can be broken into stages and revealed one piece per wrong guess.

- ## Main Lessons

<ul class="list-[circle]">
    <li>Choosing randomly from a predefined set of words</li>
    <li>Managing and updating multiple game states</li>
    <li>Validating and processing single-letter input</li>
    <li>Displaying dynamic ASCII graphics for feedback</li>
</ul>

- ## Guidelines

Feel free to implement additional features to enhance the gameplay such as,

<ul class="list-[circle]">
    <li>A “hint” feature that reveals one letter after a threshold of wrong guesses</li>
    <li>A round-counter and cumulative score across multiple games</li>
</ul>
