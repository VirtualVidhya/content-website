- ## Task

Build a text based Loan Calculator, which based on the given loan's details by user, computes the down payment, monthly EMI, total payment over the loan 
tenure and the overpayment amount.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Prompt user for:
    - total loan amount (in rupees)
    - loan tenure (in years)
    - annual interest rate (in percent)
    - down payment rate (percentage of total loan, 0 if no down payment)
- Calculate:
    - down payment
    - monthly EMI:
        - For monthly EMI, first the annual interest rate needs to be converted to monthly interest rate.
        
            ``` monthly_rate = (annual_interest_rate / 100) / 12 ```
        - Then, the tenure in years needs to be converted to number of monthly installments.
        - Now finally, calculate EMI using the standard formula:

            <code>EMI = (P x r x (1 + r)<sup>n</sup>) / ((1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1)</code>

            where, 
            
            `P` - financed principal amout after down payment 
            
            `r` - monthly interest rate
            
            `n` - number of monthly installments
    - total payment over the loan tenure
    - overpayment amount (the extra amount compared to the original loan amount that is paid over the loan tenure)
- Display the calculated values in a user friendly manner.
