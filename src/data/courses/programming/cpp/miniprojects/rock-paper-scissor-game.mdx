- ## Task

Build a text-based <LinkMd href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors' title='Rock-Paper-Scissors' /> game where the player competes 
against the computer.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
You will evolve your game program in stages gradually.

<ul>
    <li>
        Unfair Computer:
        <ul class="list-[circle]">
            <li>Prompt the player to choose “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors.” and then computer make a choice based on the player's choice such 
            that the computer always defeats the human player.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fair Chances:
        <ul class="list-[circle]">
            <li>Now to make the game fair, computer should make a truly random choice.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Endless Game:
        <ul class="list-[circle]">
            <li>A single game is never enough. So, make the game such that the player can play indefinitely until they choose to quit.</li>
            <li>Keep track of wins, losses and ties across rounds and display the running score after each round.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
