- ## Task

Develop a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing `X` and `O` on a 3x3 board. The game should determine the winner or declare a draw.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a square (Player 1: `X`, Player 2: `O`).
- A player wins if they get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- The system should: 
    - Display the board before each move. 
    - Prompt the current player to enter a move (1-9). 
    - Validate the move (ensure the chosen cell is empty). 
    - Check for a winner or a draw after every move.
