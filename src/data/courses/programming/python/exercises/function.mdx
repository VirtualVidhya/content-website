#### Q1.

What will be the output of the following programs?

<Admonition variant="caution" title="caution">
    You have to predict the output result without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>

- #### I.
    ```py
    func()

    def func():
        print("func")
    ```

- #### II.
    ```py
    def func():
        print("func")

    func
    ```

- #### III.
    ```py
    def funcB():
        print("In funcB()")

    def funcA():
        print("In funcA()")
        
        funcB()

    funcA()
    ```

- #### IV.
    ```py
    def funcA():
        print("In funcA()")
        
        funcB()

    def funcB():
        print("In funcB()")

    funcA()
    ```

---

#### Q2.

You need to display the same error message in multiple places in your program. Instead of writing the same `print()` statement repeatedly, 
design a reusable solution that makes your code more efficient and easier to maintain. Write a function that prints the error message 
and then demonstrate it by calling the function twice.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Invalid command!   [2;3m// first time calling the function[0m

Invalid command!   [2;3m// second time calling the function[0m
```

#### Q3.

What will be the output of the following programs?

<Admonition variant="caution" title="caution">
    You have to predict the output result without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>

- #### I.
    ```py
    def getNumber():
        return 10

    n = 0

    getNumber()

    print(n)
    ```

- #### II.
    ```py
    def printNumber():
        n = 10

        print(n)

    print(f"number: {printNumber()}")
    ```

- #### III.
    ```py
    def getChar():
        return 'c'

    print(f"char: {getChar()}")
    ```

- #### IV.
    ```py
    def getChar():
        char = 'c'

    print(f"char: {getChar()}")
    ```

---

#### Q4.

{/* Imagine a scenario where your program needs to take an integer input from the user multiple times and needs to validate the input to ensure 
it is a positive integer number. Instead of writing the input logic repeatedly, create a function to handle this task efficiently and 
reuse it whenever needed. */}

In a busy cafe, the barista needs to take orders from multiple customers, each time asking the number of cups for order and making sure
it is a valid positive integer number.

To solve this problem, write a program that defines a function that repeatedly prompts the user to enter the number of cups for their order
until a valid positive integer is provided, then the function should return the valid number of cups once it is obtained.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the number of cups for your order: -3
Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of cups: 0
Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of cups: 2

Thank you for your order!
You have ordered for 2 cups of coffee.
```

#### Q10.

{/* Write a program that takes two alphabets as input, then tells which alphabet comes first as per the alphabetical order. */}

In a school, when two new students enroll at the same time, the teacher needs to decide who gets the lower roll number by 
comparing their names alphabetically. Write a program that takes two students' names as input and then announce which student should receive 
the earlier roll number based on dictionary order or note if their names are identical.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter first student's name: Magan   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter second student's name: Gagan   [2;3m// user input[0m

Gagan should receive the earlier roll number.
```

{/* ```ansi
Enter first alphabet: q   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter second alphabet: g   [2;3m// user input[0m

Output: g

[2;3m// because g comes before q as per alphabetical order
``` */}

#### Q13.

You've decided to buy apples in bulk and want to get the best deal. You call three different suppliers and ask for their per-kilogram price.
Write a program that asks for the price per kilogram from three suppliers and then tells you what is the lowest price.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter price from Supplier 1 (per kg):  42.50
Enter price from Supplier 2 (per kg):  40.75

#### Q15. **_(Adv.)_**

On a remote island, treasure hunters find chests marked with numbers. Only the “magic chests” - those whose numbers can't be split 
evenly into smaller piles, hold the rare gems. Write a program that asks the user for a chest number and then declares whether it's a magic 
chest with a special treasure or just an ordinary chest.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter chest number: 23   [2;3m// user input[0m

Magic chest! You've uncovered the hidden gem.
```
