#### Q1.

Imagine you're building a simple photo-editing tool for your friend's photography blog. One of the popular looks they love is a warm “vintage sunset” filter that 
boosts reds and blues, but slightly mutes greens - just like the glow you see when the sun is setting over the horizon.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Ask the user for an image filename (or uses a default if they just press Enter) and load the selected image.
- Apply the “Vintage Sunset” filter by updating every pixel's color:
    - `new red = old red x 1.5`
    - `new green = old green x 0.7`
    - `new blue = old blue x 1.5`
- Show the image before and after applying the filter, so your friend can instantly compare the edited image against the original.

#### Q2.

You're working with environmental scientists who need an easy way to spot active forest fires in a satellite 
photo of <LinkMd href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfires_in_2017" title="Greenland's 2017 fire season" />. Your job is to write a function that lights up 
the burning areas in bright red and turns the rest of the landscape into shades of gray, so the fires jump right off the screen.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Ask the user for an image filename (or uses a default if they just press Enter) and loads the selected image.
- For each pixel, compute the average of its red, green and blue values. If the pixel's red component is greater than equal to that average, it's sufficiently red, indicating fire.
- **Highlighting Fires:** 
    - If a pixel is sufficiently red: set red = 255, green = 0, blue = 0
    - else compute the pixel's grayscale value by averaging its RGB channels and set red = green = blue = that average.
- Finally, show the original image side by side with the processed version for comparison.

#### Q3.

You're building a simple photo-editing feature for a nature website. 
Your friend wants to add a mirror reflection effect beneath each photo, as if the image is sitting on a calm lake. 
The reflected image should flip the original vertically, creating a seamless reflection.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Ask the user for an image filename (or uses a default if they just press Enter) and loads the selected image.
- Create a new blank image that is twice as tall as the original (same width), copies the original into the top half, then
generate a vertical reflection of the original into the bottom half, so the first row of the original becomes the last row of the output and so on.
- Show the image before and after applying the filter, so your friend can instantly compare the edited image against the original.
