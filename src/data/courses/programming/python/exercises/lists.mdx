#### Q7.

A teacher wants to analyze how students performed in a multiple-choice test with 10 questions.
The correct answers are stored in an array. The teacher then inputs a student's answers into another array. Your program should:
- Display how many answers are correct.
- Give the student's score. (Each correct answer is worth 10 marks.)

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// correct answers[0m
correct-answers: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B'

[2;3m// input[0m

[2;3m// output[0m
Total correct answers: 7
Score: 70
```

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// input[0m
Enter 20 ratings (1 - 5):
1 3 3 4 2 2 2 3 4 3 1 4 3 4 5 2 3 3 4 5

#### Q9. _**(Adv.)**_

A popular arcade game keeps a list of the five highest scores ever achieved, in descending order. Now they want to automate updating this
leaderboard whenever a new score arrives.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Take the five previous scores as user input (in any order).
- Sort them into descending order.
- Take a new player's score as user input.
- Then update the top five scores in descending order. 
(When a new score comes in, it needs to be added to that list in the right place and the lowest score dropped if there are more than five.)
</CollapsibleSection>

<div class="w-full my-2"></div>

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
[2;3m// input[0m

#### Q10. _**(Adv.)**_

You are shopping for `5` items, each with a known price. 
The store offers a discount coupon that costs `X` rupees and reduces the price of every item by `Y` rupees. 
If an item's price is `Y` or less, it becomes free.  

Decide whether you should buy the coupon or not. You should buy it only if the total cost after applying the discount 
(including the coupon's price) is strictly less than the total cost without the coupon.  

Write a program that takes `X`, and `Y` as input, followed by the prices of `5` items, and prints `"DO use coupon"` if buying the coupon is beneficial, otherwise `"DO NOT use coupon"`.

{/* **Expected Outut:** */}
<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
[2;3m// input[0m
Enter the coupon price (rs): 30
Enter the discount price of the coupon (rs): 15

Enter prices (rs) of
item1: 10
item2: 40
item3: 100
item4: 25
item5: 65

[2;3m// output[0m
DO use coupon

[2;3m// explanation[0m
[2;3m// Total cost of items: 10 + 40 + 100 + 25 + 65 = 240[0m

[2;3m// Total cost (after applying coupon):[0m
[2;3m// item1: (10 - 15) = free[0m
[2;3m// item2: (40 - 15) = 25[0m
[2;3m// item3: (100 - 15) = 85[0m
[2;3m// item4: (25 - 15) = 10[0m
[2;3m// item5: (65 - 15) = 50[0m
[2;3m// 0 + 25 + 85 + 10 + 50 = 170[0m

[2;3m// Total cost with discount + coupon price = 170 + 30 = 200[0m

[2;3m// Total cost without coupon: 240[0m

[2;3m// 200 < 240, so it is beneficial to use the coupon.[0m

#### Q11.

A group of friends is playing a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell can either be empty (`.`), filled with `X` or `O`.

As the game progresses, they need a way to store the current state of the game board and update it after each move.
{/* <!-- - Allow a player to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell. --> */}
{/* <!-- - Ensure that a player cannot place a mark in an already filled position. --> */}

At this moment, the game board looks like this:

```ansi
X  O  X  
.  .  O  
X  .  . 

[2;3m// grid cell numbers
// 1 2 3
// 4 5 6
// 7 8 9[0m
```

- Your task is to: Store this current state into a game data-set and display it on the screen.

Now, it's Player O's turn, and they want to place their mark in the middle row, first position i.e. cell number 4.

- Your next task is to: Update the board with the new move and again display the updated game board after the move.

#### Q12.

An air-quality station in your city measures the fine particulate concentration (<LinkMd href="https://airly.org/en/what-is-pm10-and-what-is-pm2-5/" title='PM2.5' /> in µg/m³) 
at four different times of the day: morning, noon, evening and night. The station collects this data every day for a full week.

Write a program that:
- Store the daily temperature readings by taking input from user.
- Allows the user to check the average PM2.5 reading for any given day.
- Identify the highest and lowest PM2.5 reading recorded during the week and display at what time of the day they occurred.

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi

#### Q13. _**(Adv.)**_

A small cinema hall has a fixed seating arrangement with multiple rows (`5`) and columns (`6`). Some seats are already booked, while others are available.

Develop a seat booking system where:
- The user can check seat availability before buying a ticket. (Initially all seats are available.)
- A user can select a seat, and if it's available, it gets booked automatically. (Ensure that your system does not allow booking of an already occupied seat.)
- Display the updated seating chart after each booking.

#### Q14. _**(Adv.)**_

A hospital consists of multiple floors (`3`), each with a certain number of rooms (`2`), and each room has a fixed number of beds (`4`). Due to rising patient intake, the hospital administration wants to efficiently manage the availability of beds across all floors.

Your task is to develop a program that:
- Keeps track of which beds are occupied or vacant in each room.
- Allows hospital staff to check bed availability for a given room and floor.
- Displays the total number of vacant beds in the hospital at any time.

The hospital needs a solution to avoid overbooking beds and improve efficiency.

#### Q13.

A chessboard is naturally an 8x8 grid. We can represent it as a 2D list of strings, where each cell holds a piece code 
(e.g. "wK" for white king, "bQ" for black queen) or ".." for empty.

Problem Scenario:
You're building a simple game-state tracker for chess moves. Using only nested lists, you need to:

- Initialize an 8x8 list with a given position (for example, the standard starting setup or any mid-game arrangement).
- Display the board in a human-readable form (rows 8→1, columns a→h).
- Query any square to see what piece (if any) occupies it.
- Execute a move by updating the source and destination squares (handle captures by overwriting).
- Count pieces:
    - Total pieces remaining for each side.
    - How many pawns, knights, etc., each side has.
    - Locate all pieces of a given type (e.g. list all white rooks' positions). */}
