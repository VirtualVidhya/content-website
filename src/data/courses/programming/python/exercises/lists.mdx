#### Q7.

A teacher wants to analyze how students performed in a multiple-choice test with 10 questions.
The correct answers are stored in an array. The teacher then inputs a student's answers into another array. Your program should:
- Display how many answers are correct.
- Give the student's score. (Each correct answer is worth 10 marks.)

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// correct answers[0m
correct-answers: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B'

[2;3m// input[0m
Enter student answers: A B D D A C C D B B

[2;3m// output[0m
Total correct answers: 7
Score: 70
```

#### Q8.

A streaming service has just released a new movie and collected star-ratings from viewers. Your program should:

- Read in the `N` (where `N` > 15) ratings (each a number from 1 to 5).
- Calculate and display, for each rating level, the number of votes received and the percentage of the total votes.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// input[0m
Enter 20 ratings (1 - 5):
1 3 3 4 2 2 2 3 4 3 1 4 3 4 5 2 3 3 4 5

[2;3m// output[0m
Rating distribution:
1 star: 2 votes (10%)
2 star: 4 votes (20%)
3 star: 7 votes (35%)
4 star: 5 votes (25%)
5 star: 2 votes (10%)
```

#### Q9.

A popular arcade game keeps a list of the five highest scores ever achieved, in descending order. Now they want to automate updating this
leaderboard whenever a new score arrives.

(When a new score comes in, it needs to be added to that list in the right place and the lowest score dropped if there are more than five. )

- #### I.

    Your program should:
    - Take the current five top scores (from highest to lowest) as user input.
    - Take a new player's score as user input.
    - Then update the top five scores list in descending order.

    **Expected Output:**

    ```ansi
    [2;3m// input[0m
    Enter the current top 5 scores (highest to lowest): 96 93 92 85 79
    
    Enter the new score:
    87

    [2;3m// output[0m
    High-score list:
    1. 96
    2. 93
    3. 92
    4. 87
    5. 85
    ```

- #### II. _**(Adv.)**_

    Now to enhance the program:
    - Take the five previous scores as user input (in any order).
    - Sort them into descending order.
    - Take a new player's score as user input.
    - Then update the top five scores list in descending order.

    **Expected Output:**

    ```ansi
    [2;3m// input[0m
    Enter the previous 5 scores: 72 99 68 87 93

    [2;3m// output[0m
    High-score list:
    1. 99
    2. 93
    3. 87
    4. 72
    5. 68
    
    [2;3m// input[0m
    Enter the new score:
    75

    [2;3m// output[0m
    High-score list:
    1. 99
    2. 93
    3. 87
    4. 75
    5. 72
    ```

#### Q10. _**(Adv.)**_

You are shopping for `5` items, each with a known price. 
The store offers a discount coupon that costs `X` rupees and reduces the price of every item by `Y` rupees. 
If an item's price is `Y` or less, it becomes free.  

Decide whether you should buy the coupon or not. You should buy it only if the total cost after applying the discount 
(including the coupon's price) is strictly less than the total cost without the coupon.  

Write a program that takes `X`, and `Y` as input, followed by the prices of `5` items, and prints `"DO use coupon"` if buying the coupon is beneficial, otherwise `"DO NOT use coupon"`.

**Expected Outut:**

```ansi
[2;3m// input[0m
Enter the coupon price (rs): 30
Enter the discount price of the coupon (rs): 15

Enter prices (rs) of
item1: 10
item2: 40
item3: 100
item4: 25
item5: 65

[2;3m// output[0m
DO use coupon

[2;3m// explanation[0m
[2;3m// Total cost of items: 10 + 40 + 100 + 25 + 65 = 240[0m

[2;3m// Total cost (after applying coupon):[0m
[2;3m// item1: (10 - 15) = free[0m
[2;3m// item2: (40 - 15) = 25[0m
[2;3m// item3: (100 - 15) = 85[0m
[2;3m// item4: (25 - 15) = 10[0m
[2;3m// item5: (65 - 15) = 50[0m
[2;3m// 0 + 25 + 85 + 10 + 50 = 170[0m

[2;3m// Total cost with discount + coupon price = 170 + 30 = 200[0m

[2;3m// Total cost without coupon: 240[0m

[2;3m// 200 < 240, so it is beneficial to use the coupon.[0m
```
