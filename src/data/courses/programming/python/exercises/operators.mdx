#### Q1.

Write a program to calculate the perimeter and the area of a rectangle.
Take the length and the width of a rectangle from user and then prints the value of perimeter and area of that given rectangle.

{/* <Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    You can safely assume that the value of length and width will always be an integer.
</Admonition> */}

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the length of a rectangle: 10   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the width of a rectangle: 5   [2;3m// user input[0m

Perimeter: 30
Area: 50

[2;3m// Perimeter = 2 * (l + w) = 2 * (10 + 5) = 30[0m
[2;3m// Area = l * w = 10 * 5 = 50[0m
```

<Admonition variant="caution" title="caution">
    You have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>

- #### I.
    ```py
    print(6 + 5 * 4 % 3)
    ```

    ```py
    x = 9
    y = 2

    z = x // y

    print(z)

    x = z % y

    print(x)

    y = z ** x

    print(y)
    ```

- #### V.
    ```py

#### Q3.

There are 10 seats placed in a circle for an event, numbered from 1 to 10. People are arriving and standing in a waiting line (queue). Each person is given a seat based on their position in the line.

Write a program where the user enters their position in the waiting line (queue) and the program tells them which seat number they will get.

(For e.g. if someone is the 11th in line, they should get seat 1 again because the seats are arranged in a circle. If someone is 12th, they get seat 2
and so on.)

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter your queue number: 23   [2;3m// user input[0m

Your seat number is: 3
```

- #### I.
    ```py
    message1 = "Linus Torvalds, the creator of the linux kernel once said -"
    message2 = "Most of the good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public,"
    message3 = "but because it is fun to program."

    print(message1)
    print('{} {}'.format(message2, message3))
    ```

- #### II. 
    ```py
    show_name = "Monty Python's Flying Circus"

    print("The name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called -", end=' ')
    print(show_name)
    ```

- #### III.

    quote = '"Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Human beings are ' \
    'incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination."'

        print(quote)

    print('-', name)
    ```

#### Q5.

Write a program that takes the cost of any 3 food items from the user (e.g. a packet of biscuit, a packet of waffer, an icecream cone). Then 
- Print the **Total Cost** of the items
- Then calculate a 18% GST (tax) on the total cost of the items and print that **GST Amount**
- Finally print the **Total Bill** amount, adding Total Cost & GST Amount

{/* (**TIP:** Decide the data types of the variables needed in the program with proper logical consideration so that no data loss occur in the output.) */}
{/* <Admonition variant="hint" title="tip">
    Decide the data types of the variables needed in the program with proper logical consideration so that no data loss occur in the output.
</Admonition> */}

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the cost of 3 food items: 50 20 60   [2;3m// user input[0m
Total Cost: 130
GST Amount : 23.4
Total Bill: 153.4

[2;3m// Total Cost = 50 + 20 + 60 = 130[0m
[2;3m// GST Amount = Total Cost * 18 / 100 = 130 * 18 / 100 = 23.4[0m
[2;3m// Total Bill = Total Cost + GST Amount = 130 + 23.4 = 153.4[0m
```

#### Q6.

Write a program that takes a value of radius from user, then find the circumference and area of a circle for a given radius.

{/* (**NOTE:** Take 3.14 as the value of pi.) */}
<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    Take **_3.14_** as the value of **_pi_**.
</Admonition>

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the value of radius: 5   [2;3m// user input[0m

Circumference: 31.4
Area: 78.5

[2;3m// Circumference = 2 * pi * r = 2 * 3.14 * 5 = 31.4
// Area = pi * r * r = 3.14 * 5 * 5 = 78.5
```

#### Q7.

Write a program that takes a value of temperature in Celsius from user, then convert it into Kelvin and Fahrenheit.

The formulas for Celsius to Kelvin and Celsius to Fahrenheit are -
- <code>Kelvin = Celsius + 273</code>
- <code>Fahrenheit = 9/5 * Celsius + 32</code>

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the value of temperature in Celsius: 30   [2;3m// user input[0m
temperature in Kelvin: 303
temperature in Fahrenheit: 86

[2;3m// Kelvin = Celsius + 273 = 30 + 273 = 303
// Fahrenheit = 9/5 * Celsius + 32 = 9/5 * 30 + 32 = 86
```

#### Q8.

You're helping a government planning department analyze how a country's population is expected to grow over time. Based on the current population, 
an estimated annual growth rate and a time period in years, you need to calculate what the population will be at the end of that period.

<LinkMd href="https://calculator.academy/population-growth-calculator/" title="Population growth" /> can be calculated by looking at the change in population over time. The formula for population growth is -

<code>pt = p0 x (1 + r)<sup>t</sup></code>

Where, 
- `pt` - total population after time t
- `p0` - initial population
- `r` - rate of growth
- `t` - total time in years

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the initial population (in crores): 142   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the rate of growth (in %): 0.875   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the time (in years): 5   [2;3m// user input[0m

Total population after given time (in crores): 148.322
```
