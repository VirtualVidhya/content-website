#### Q1.

What will be the output of the following program?

<Admonition variant="caution" title="caution">
    You have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>

<div class="w-full my-8"></div>
  
```py
print("Hello,", "àª•à«‡àª® àª›à«‹?")
```

<ol class="list-[lower-alpha] bold-li">
    <li>Hello,àª•à«‡àª® àª›à«‹?</li>
    <li>"Hello, àª•à«‡àª® àª›à«‹?"</li>
    <li>Hello, àª•à«‡àª® àª›à«‹?</li>
    <li>Hello, how are you?</li>
</ol>

#### Q2.

Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer number and then enter a second integer number. The program should tell the user what the result of adding and subtracting those two numbers is.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter the first integer number: 6   [2;3m// user input[0m
Enter the second integer number: 4   [2;3m// user input[0m

6 + 4 = 10
6 - 4 = 2
```

    print(a, b)

    a = 2 - b

    print(a, b)
    ```

- #### IV.
    ```py

    b = 0

    print(a * b)

    42 = a

    print(a * b)
    ```

- #### V.
    ```py
    a = 5

    print(a * b)
    ```

---

#### Q4.

Write a program that takes an integer number from user and then prints the doubled and tripled value of that number.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter an integer: 4   [2;3m// user input[0m

Double of 4: 8
Triple of 4: 12
```

#### Q5.

Based on how you should name a variable, indicate whether each variable name mentioned below is **conventional** _(follows best practices)_, **unconventional** _(compiler will accept but does not follow best practices)_, or **invalid** _(will not compile)_, and why.

    <li><code>sum</code></li>
    <li><code>_apples</code></li>
    <li><code>VALUE</code></li>
    <li><code>my variable name</code></li>
    <li><code>TotalCustomers</code></li>

#### Q7.

Write a program that prints the statement `Once a computer scientist, Frederik Brooks said - "What one programmer can do it in 1 week, 
two programmers can do it in 2 weeks."`.

#### Q8.

Write a program that prompts the user to input their name and marks of 3 subjects, then 
calculates and displays their percentage.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Enter your name: Honey   [2;3m// user input[0m

Enter the marks of subject1: 75   [2;3m// user input[0m
