- ## Task

Create a text-based lively chatbot that engages with the user, gathers personal details and provides a fun conversation via several activities in phases.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- **Bot Introduction:**
    - The bot first introduces itself with their name, birth-year and creator name.
- **Name Reminder:**
    - Then it asks the user's name and greets them personally.
- **Age guessing:**
    - By asking the user for the remainders of their age when divided by 3, 5 and 7, the bot reveals their age by calculating using
    <LinkMd href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem' title='Chinese Remainder Theorem' />:

        <code>n = (r<sub>1</sub>m<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub>m<sub>2</sub> + r<sub>3</sub>m<sub>3</sub>) % n<sub>1</sub>n<sub>2</sub>n<sub>3</sub></code>

        where,

            `n` - the number to be guessed
            
            <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> - remainder when `n` is divided by the <code>i<sup>th</sup> number</code>

            <code>m<sub>1</sub></code> - 70, <code>m<sub>2</sub></code> - 21, <code>m<sub>3</sub></code> - 15 (<code>m<sub>i</sub></code> is a 
            <LinkMd href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse" title="modular inverse" />)

            <code>n<sub>1</sub></code> - 3, <code>n<sub>2</sub></code> - 5, <code>n<sub>3</sub></code> - 7
- **Joke Time:**
    - The bot offers to tell a joke upon request and delivers a random, lighthearted joke from a built-in collection.
- **Riddle Time:**
    - The bot challenges the user with a multiple-choice question. If the answer is incorrect, it prompts again until the correct choice is selected.
- **Farewell:**
    - Finally, the bot congratulates the user on completing the interaction and says goodbye.

<CollapsibleSection title="Expected Output">
```ansi
Hello! My name is Chitti.
I was created in 2025.
How can I assist you today?

Please, remind me your name: Vasi   [2;3m// user input[0m
What a lovely name you have, Vasi!

Let me guess your age.
Please, enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Remainder when divided by 3: 1  [2;3m// user input[0m
Remainder when divided by 5: 2  [2;3m// user input[0m
Remainder when divided by 7: 1  [2;3m// user input[0m
Your age is 22, that's a good time to start programming!

Would you like to hear a joke? (yes/no): yes    [2;3m// user input[0m
Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Please, choose the correct option (1-4): 2  [2;3m// user input[0m
Correct!

Congratulations, have a nice day!
