- ## Task

Create a "Guess the Lucky Number" game.

As the admin, set a "lucky number" between 1 and 100 in your program. The user (player) will attempt to guess this number.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
<div>
    The program should repeatedly prompt the user for a guess until they either:
    <ul>
        <li>Correctly match the lucky number.</li>
        <li>Enter 0 to exit the game (at any time).</li>
        <li>The player uses up all **10 allowed guesses**</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    To help the player, provide hints after each guess:
    <ul>
        <li>If the guess is larger than the lucky number, display a message indicating it is too high.</li>
        <li>If the guess is smaller, indicate it is too low.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

This feedback allows the player to narrow down their guesses and find the lucky number.
