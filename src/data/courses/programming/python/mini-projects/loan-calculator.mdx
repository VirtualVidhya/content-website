- ## Task

Build a text based Loan Calculator, which based on the given loan's details by user, computes the down payment, monthly EMI, total payment over the loan 
tenure and the overpayment amount.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
<ul>
    <li>
    Prompt user for
        <ul class="list-[circle]">
            <li>total loan amount (in rupees)</li>
            <li>loan tenure (in years)</li>
            <li>annual interest rate (in percent)</li>
            <li>down payment rate (percentage of total loan, 0 if no down payment)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Calculate
        <ul class="list-[circle]">
            <li>down payment</li>
            <li>
            monthly EMI:
                <ul class="list-[square]">
                    <li>
                        For monthly EMI, first the annual interest rate needs to be converted to monthly interest rate.

                        ``` monthly_rate = (annual_interest_rate / 100) / 12 ```
                    </li>
                    <li>Then, the tenure in years needs to be converted to number of monthly installments.</li>
                    <li>
                        Now finally, calculate EMI using the standard formula:

                        ``` EMI = [P x r x (1 + r)^n] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] ```

                        where, 
                        
                        `P` - financed principal amout after down payment 
                        
                        `r` - monthly interest rate a
                        
                        `n` - number of monthly installments.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>total payment over the loan tenure</li>
            <li>overpayment amount (the extra amount compared to the original loan amount that is paid over the loan tenure)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Display the calculated values in a user friendly manner.</li>
</ul>
</CollapsibleSection>
