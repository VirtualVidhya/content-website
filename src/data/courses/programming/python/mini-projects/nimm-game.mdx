- ## Task

Create a text-based strategy game called <LinkMd href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" title="Nimm" />, where two players alternately take stones 
from a shared pile until there are no stones left, the last one to take a stone loses.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- The game starts with a pile of 20 stones between the players.
- The two players alternate turns (Player 1 goes first).
- On a given turn, a player may take either **1** or **2** stones from the pile.
- The two players continue until the center pile has run out of stones.
- The last player to take a stone loses.
{/* - Before each move, display the number of stones remaining. */}
{/* - Prompt the current player to enter how many stones to take. */}
{/* - Validate the input: it must be `1` or `2` and not exceed the stones left. */}
{/* - Subtract the chosen amount from the pile. */}
{/* - When the pile reaches zero, declare the **other** player (not the one who just moved) as the winner. */}
