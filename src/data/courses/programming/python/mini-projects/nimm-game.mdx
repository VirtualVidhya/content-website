- ### Task

Create a text-based <LinkMd href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" title="Nimm Game" /> for two players who alternately take stones from a shared pile. 
In this version, the player who takes the last stone loses.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- Start with a pile of 20 stones.
- Players alternate turns (Player 1 goes first). 
- On each turn, a player may remove **1** or **2** stones.
- Before each move, display the number of stones remaining.
- Prompt the current player to enter how many stones to take.
- Validate the input: it must be `1` or `2` and not exceed the stones left.
- Subtract the chosen amount from the pile.
- When the pile reaches zero, declare the **other** player (not the one who just moved) as the winner.
