- ## Task

Create a full-fledged text-based password generator, that will ask the user to specify:
- Total length of the password
- Whether to include uppercase letters (`A - Z`)
- Whether to include lowercase letters (`a - z`)
- Whether to include digits (`0 - 9`)
- Whether to include special characters (`! @ # $ % ^ & *`)
- Minimum number of digits
- Minimum number of special characters
- Whether to avoid ambiguous characters (e.g. `O 0 l 1 I`)

Then generate and display a random password that meets all of these user requirements.

{/* <CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a square (Player 1: `X`, Player 2: `O`).
- A player wins if they get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- The system should: 
    - Display the board before each move. 
    - Prompt the current player to enter a move (1-9). 
    - Validate the move (ensure the chosen cell is empty). 
    - Check for a winner or a draw after every move.

Min digits: 3 
Min specials: 2 
Avoid ambiguous characters? (y/n): y
