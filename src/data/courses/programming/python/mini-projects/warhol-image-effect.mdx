- ## Task

Imagine you're helping a digital artist build a quick “Pop-Art Collage” app, inspired by <LinkMd href="https://www.theartist.me/art-inspiration/famous-andy-warhol-paintings/" title="Andy Warhol's famous style" />. 
The artist wants to take a favorite square photo and turn it into a vibrant 2-row by 3-column grid, where each copy is recolored in a bold, unexpected way. 
The goal is to let users experiment with fun color shifts and see their image transformed into a modern pop-art masterpiece.

<CollapsibleSection title="Instructions">
- **Path Extraction & Placement:**
    - Ask the user for an image filename (or uses a default if they just press Enter) and load the selected image.
    - Create a blank canvas large enough for 2 rows x 3 columns of these patches.
- **Recoloring & Building the Collage:**
    - For each of the six grid positions, generate a recolored patch with different `(red_scale, green_scale, blue_scale)` values.
    - Place each recolored patch into its spot on the final canvas.
- Finally, show the original image side by side with the processed version for comparison.
