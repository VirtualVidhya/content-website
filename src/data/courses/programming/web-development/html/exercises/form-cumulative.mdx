A robotics startup wants to offer customers an online “Dream Robot Builder” where they can customize every aspect of their personal robot companion, 
to help them build a webpage with form where users can provide all the information to customize their robot.

An example website is shared here for reference: <LinkMd href="https://virtualvidhya.github.io/exercises-html/form-cumulative/" title="Website Preview" />

<div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-start">
    <p class="!my-2.5">You can download all the content resources (images, text etc.) needed for the website from here in a zip format:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.zip" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>
