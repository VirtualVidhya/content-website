- ### Q1.

Take a look at the form below and write the HTML needed to recreate it exactly—using the right semantic tags, form controls and label associations. 
Your version should collect:

- A “Personal Details” heading
- Username and password fields
- An address textarea
- A phone number input
- A “Role” radio group (Student, Teacher, Professional, Other)
- A date-of-birth picker
- A “Technical Skills” checkbox list
- Submit and reset buttons

Make sure each control uses the correct `<input>` type, is wrapped in a `<label>` (or paired via for/id) and the form structure follows best practices for 
accessibility and semantics.

A screenshot of the example is shared below:

- ### Q2.

Consider the `html` code snippet given below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <label>First Name</label>
      <br />
      <input type="text" placeholder="Tim" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <form>
      <label>Last Name</label>
      <br />
      <input type="text" placeholder="Lee" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <form>
      <label>Email</label>
      <br />
      <input type="email" placeholder="tim.lee@email.com" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <form>
      <label>Password:</label>
      <br />
      <input type="password" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

The above code currently displays the form as shown in the screenshot below:

This HTML form is for collecting user's personal Information. It currently displays content but isn't using the most appropriate tags. 
Identify and fix any markup issues - improving its structure and semantics, so the form displays and functions correctly.
