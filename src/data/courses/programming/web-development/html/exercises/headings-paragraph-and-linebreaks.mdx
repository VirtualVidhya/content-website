- ## Task

A local technology museum has commissioned you to craft an engaging webpage that walks visitors through the origin, key milestones and ongoing evolution of HTML, 
so build a page for them that tells this story in a clear, logical flow.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:gap-3 justify-center items-start lg:justify-start lg:items-center">
    <p class="!my-2.5 lg:!my-5">You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>
