- ## Task

A web education platform wants to give newcomers a friendly, hands-on introduction to the history of internet, so
create a simple multi-page website that show major milestones in the history of internet in a clear and engaging way.

An example website is shared here for reference: <LinkMd href="https://virtualvidhya.github.io/exercises-html/images-and-links/" title="Website Preview" />

<div class="w-full mt-8"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-start">
    <p class="!my-2.5">You can download all the content resources (images, text etc.) needed for the website from here in a zip format:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.zip" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>
