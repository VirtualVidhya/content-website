{/* - ## Task */}

- ### Q1.

A web education platform wants to give newcomers a friendly, hands-on introduction to the World Wide Web, so
create a simple webpage that explains the basics of the web in a clear and engaging way.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:
![Preview](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/html/exercises/ordered-and-unordered-lists/1.png)

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:gap-3 justify-center items-start lg:justify-start lg:items-center">
    <p class="!my-2.5 lg:!my-5">You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>

- ## Main Lessons

Organizing content clearly by using both unordered and ordered lists.

---

- ## Guidelines

Feel free to have the content as per the topic of your interest, but the structural layout of the webpage should be the same as the example given above. */}

- ### Q2.

Consider the `html` code snippet given below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>List Elements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Front-end Web Development</h2>
    <p>These are the core technologies used in front-end web development:</p>

    <li>
      HTML
      <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      CSS
      <p>CSS is used to style and layout web pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript
      <p>JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive.</p>
    </li>
  </body>
</html>
```

The above code currently displays the form as shown in the screenshot below:

Although this HTML displays the content, it doesn't seem to follow proper HTML semantics and structure. 
Identify what's invalid or missing and fix it.
