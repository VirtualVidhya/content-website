- ## Task

A web education platform wants to give newcomers a friendly, hands-on introduction to the World Wide Web, so
create a simple webpage that explains the basics of the web in a clear and engaging way.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:
![Preview](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/html/exercises/ordered-and-unordered-lists/1.png)

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here: <span class="mx-1"></span> <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>

- ## Main Lessons

Organizing content clearly by using both unordered and ordered lists.

---

- ## Guidelines

Feel free to have the content as per the topic of your interest, but the structural layout of the webpage should be the same as the example given above.
