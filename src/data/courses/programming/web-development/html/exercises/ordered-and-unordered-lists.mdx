- ## Task

A web education platform wants to give newcomers a friendly, hands-on introduction to the World Wide Web, so
create a simple webpage that explains the basics of the web in a clear and engaging way.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:
![Preview](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/html/exercises/ordered-and-unordered-lists/1.png)

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:gap-3 justify-center items-start lg:justify-start lg:items-center">
    <p class="!my-2.5 lg:!my-5">You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>
