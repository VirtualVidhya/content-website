- ### Q1.

A media education portal needs a vibrant “YouTube Insights” page that presents key platform statistics in a clear table format, 
so build a webpage that displays YouTube metrics in a tabular form with a header, body rows and a footer citation.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:
![Preview](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/html/exercises/table/1.png)

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:gap-3 justify-center items-start lg:justify-start lg:items-center">
    <p class="!my-2.5 lg:!my-5">You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>

Feel free to have the content as per the topic of your interest, but the structural layout of the webpage should be the same as the example given above. */}

- ### Q2.

Consider the `html` code snippet given below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>HTML Elements</title>
  </head>

    <h1>History of CSS</h1>
    <p>
      CSS was created HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to allow web designers to change the
      layout, colors, and fonts of their websites. Originally, websites were
      meant to be used by researchers only, so the decoration did not matter.
      However, when websites became widespread, the need to make them look nice
      grew.

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <li>1994 - HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.</li>
    <li>1996 - The first version of CSS was invented.</li>
    <li>
      1998 - CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very
      different from the other versions, instead of being a single monolithic
      specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as
      modules. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall
      specification, and either added new features or refined and extended
      existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification
      were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of
      CSS.
    </li>
    <li>2011 - CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS 2</li>
