- ## Task

A media education portal needs a vibrant “YouTube Insights” page that presents key platform statistics in a clear table format, 
so build a webpage that displays YouTube metrics in a tabular form with a header, body rows and a footer citation.

A screenshot of the example webpage is shared below:

<div class="w-full mt-10"></div>

<div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:gap-3 justify-center items-start lg:justify-start lg:items-center">
    <p class="!my-2.5 lg:!my-5">You can download the content for the webpage in text format from here:</p> 
    <FileDownload fileSrc={FileSrc} fileName="content.txt" />
</div>

<div class="w-full mb-12"></div>
