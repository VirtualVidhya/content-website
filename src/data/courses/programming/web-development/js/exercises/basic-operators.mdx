import Admonition from '@/components/Admonition.astro';

#### Q1.

Apply the right assignment operator, which will result in x being 20

<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    In the blank, only an assignment operator can be added, any extra variable isn't allowed to be added here. 
i.e. this can't be done: **_x = x + y_**
</Admonition>

<div class="w-full my-8"></div>

```jsx
x = 15;
y = 5;
x __ y;
```

#### Q2.

Apply the right assignment operator, which will result in x being 30

```jsx
x = 10;
y = 3;
x __ y;
```
