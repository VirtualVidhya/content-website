#### Q1.

Create a simple HTML + CSS with a `h1` heading and 3 `button` as per the image.

![Image 1](@/assets/images/courses/programming/webdev/js/exercises/dom-events-I/1.png)

Initially the `heading` is in black color.

Now write a JS functionality to change the color of heading based on which respective color of button is clicked.

#### Q2. 

Make a on-off button using JS.

For e.g. 

letâ€™s say we initially have a button in this `on` state.

![Image 2](@/assets/images/courses/programming/webdev/js/exercises/dom-events-I/2.png)

Once you click on it, it goes into `off` state.

Now if it's clicked again, it will be in `on` state.

<Admonition variant="hint" title="hint">
    Use **_classList_** and its relevant methods to change styling of a button based on in which state it is currently.
</Admonition>
