#### Q1.

Create a simple webpage using HTML & (if required) CSS.

Now on pressing the `Escape` key, a header menu bar should pop-up (toggle).

**Expected Output:**

On pressing `Escape` key again, the header menu bar should get hidden.

So in short, the header menu bar should toggle (become visible & hidden) on pressing `Escape` key only.

#### Q2.

Create a student entry form.

Create a simple HTML with a `h1` for the app heading, a `form` with `input` to add a student name and `submit` button to add a student entry.

Now on clicking the `add button` after entering name in the `input field`, the student name should be added to the page in the form of a list item.

**Expected Output:**

**Advance Tasks:** 

If you are done with the above tasks then do the following ones.

- Names should be added as `ordered list` items instead of default `unordered list` items.
- Empty spaces from the start and end of the input entry should be removed before adding it on the webpage.
- If the `add` has been clicked with empty `input field` then nothing should happen. (Currently if you click add button with an empty input field then an empty list item gets added.)

#### Q3.

Create a student course enrollment form.

Create a simple HTML with a `h1` for the app heading, a `form` with `input` to add a student name, `input` to add student age, `input checkbox` to select skills and `submit` button to add a student entry.

![Image 3](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/js/exercises/dom-events-II/3.png)

Now on clicking the `Check Eligibility button`, the `form` should get reset and at the bottom of the form, a message should be shown to notify the student whether he/she is eligible to enroll & if not eligible then provide a reason as well.

**Expected Output:**

- Ineligible

- Eligible

    ![Image 5](@/assets/courses/programming/webdev/js/exercises/dom-events-II/5.png)

**Guidelines:**

- If a form gets submitted with empty name input field or absurd value of age (negative or some very high value i.e. more than 120) then give an alert
warning with a reason mentioned in it.

- Student is eligible for the course if he/she is older than 15 years, can operate computer and familiar with internet.

    Add the following reasoning message after the "Sorry `StudentName`! You are not eligible for the course enrollment." message -

    - If not older than 15 years : "Because you're still quite young to learn this."
    - If can't operate computer : "Because you can't operate a Computer, which is mandatory for this course."
    - If not familiar with internet : "Because you aren't quite familiar with the Internet, which is mandatory for this course."
