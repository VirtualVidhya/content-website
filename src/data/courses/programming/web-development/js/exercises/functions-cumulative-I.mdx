#### Q1.

Create a function that returns the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`

---

#### Q2.

Create a function that returns the concatenation of all strings in an array

---

#### Q3.

Create a function to convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and then Celsius to Fahrenheit.

(**HINT:** `Celsius = Kelvin - 273` & `Fahrenheit = (9/5) * Celsius + 32`) 

(**TIP:** Create separate functions for both the functionalities. First user will give input in Kelvin, convert it to Celsius then user will give input in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit.)

#### Q4. _(Adv.)_

Thereâ€™s a garments shop. They want to have a digital solution which helps them find if a particular product (shirt/t-shirt/pant etc.) is available in a particular size and color or not.

Make a function that gives us the availability status of a product on providing a particular size and color.

<Admonition variant="hint" title="hint">
    The data set for available sizes and colors for a particular product is being stored already. 
    So choose the data structure appropriately to keep track of that.
</Admonition>

<div class="w-full my-8"></div>

<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    Currently for the simplicity, just consider the program for a single product only.
</Admonition>

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
[2;3m// let's say if user asks for a M size & black color
// (Think how will user provide this info using input.)

// output[0m
The M size black colored Jersey is available.
```
