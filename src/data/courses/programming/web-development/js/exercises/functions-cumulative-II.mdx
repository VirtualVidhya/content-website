    Some questions may take more time to solve as it takes time for any beginner to build logic for approaching such programming problems 
    so donâ€™t get discouraged.

#### Q1.

Write a JavaScript function that returns array elements larger than a given number.

```ansi
[2;3m// for a given set of numbers [1, 5, 23, 16, 54, 39, 41] & given number - 29

// output[0m
result:
54
39
41
```
---

#### Q2.

Write a JavaScript function to extract unique characters from a given string.

```ansi
[2;3m// for a given string "abcdabcdefgggh" 

// output[0m
ans - "abcdefgh"
```
---

#### Q3.

Write a JavaScript function that accepts a list of country names as input and
returns the longest country name as output.

```ansi
[2;3m// for a given set of countries ["Australia", "Germany", "United States of America"]

// output[0m
"United States of America"
```

#### Q4.

Write a JavaScript function to count the number of vowels in a given string.

```ansi
[2;3m// for a given string "almond"

// output (here a & o are vowels)[0m
2
```

#### Q5. _(Adv.)_

Write a JavaScript function to generate a random number within a given custom range
(start, end).

---

#### Q6. _(Adv.)_

Write a program to print all the prime numbers in a given range of numbers.

For e.g. letâ€™s say if user give the first number as 7 and the second number as 43, then program needs to print all the prime numbers between 
7 & 43 including 7 & 43.

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
7
11
13
17
19
23
29
31
37
41
43
```

<Admonition variant="hint" title="hint">
    Divide your program into separate tasks, in this program we have a main big task where we have to print all the numbers in a given 
    range which are prime. Now first & for most, the important part is to decide whether a number is prime or not, so you can 
    just focus on that part initially. Make a separate function to handle that logic. After youâ€™re done with it, the task is to print prime numbers 
    in a given range, so you have to indirectly check for multiple numbers.
