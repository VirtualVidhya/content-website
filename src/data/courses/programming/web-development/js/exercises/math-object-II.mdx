#### Q1.

Create a program that generates a random number representing a dice roll.

<Admonition variant="hint" title="hint">
    The dice has 6 possible outcomes between 1 & 6 so the randomly generated number should be between 1 & 6
</Admonition>

---

#### Q2. _(Adv.)_

Create a program to choose a lucky winner of a contest.

<Admonition variant="hint" title="hint">
    Assume you have a set of customers (their data in form of their name) and for a draw, you have to randomly select a lucky customer.
</Admonition>

**Expected Output:**

```ansi
Lucky winner of the contest is `CustomerName`.
```

<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    Your program should be independent of the number of customers, means if the number of customers changes even then your program will work without 
    changing anything inside your code.
