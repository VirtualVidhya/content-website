#### Q1.

Assume we are making a tic-tac-toe game.

- #### I.
Now as the game progresses, we continuously need to keep track of the filled and unfilled cells of our grid. 
For that, create a 2D array to represent the following tic-tac-toe game state.

- #### II.

Now letâ€™s say that the next player put `O` in the first row at the middle position, so fill that slot with the given input in our array as well.
