#### Q1.

Take password from user as input using `prompt`.

Now generally in practice, spaces aren’t allowed in password, so remove unnecessary spaces from start and end, then store it, then print it for testing.

#### Q2.

Take email from user as input using `prompt`.

Now generally in practice, we prefer email to be in all small case, so convert it into lowercase, also remove unnecessary spaces from start & 
end for safety (User might have added them by mistake), then store it, at last print it for testing.

#### Q3.

For the string:

`let str = “LetslearnJS”;`

predict the output of the following operations:

- `str.slice(4,9);`
- `str.indexOf(”ea”);`
- `str.replace(”JS”, ”CSS”);` 

<Admonition variant="caution" title="caution">
    You have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code.
</Admonition>
