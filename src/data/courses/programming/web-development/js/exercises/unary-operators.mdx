<Admonition variant="note" title="note">
    In all the below exercises you have to predict the output yourself without running/executing the code. 
    Predict the value of each variable after that statement gets executed.
</Admonition>

for e.g.

```jsx
let a = 1;       // a = 1
a++;             // a = 2
let b = a + 3;   // a = 2     b = 5
let c = a + b;   // a = 2     b = 5     c = 7
```

b = ++a;
```

#### Q2.

What is the value of each variable in each line of code?

```jsx
let x = 5;             
let y = --x;           
let z = y--;           
x = ++z;               
y = --z;               
z = x++;               
```
