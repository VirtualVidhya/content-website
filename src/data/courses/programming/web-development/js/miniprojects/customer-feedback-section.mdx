- ## Task

Make a small component we often see on shopping related websites which is a Customer Feedback for an item, where user can select number of stars in terms of review 
for an item and there will be a visual representation of what that amount of stars signify in the form of an emoji and review text. 

An example is given at the below link.

<LinkMd href="https://virtualvidhya.github.io/MiniProjects-JS/CustomerFeedback/" title="WebPage Preview" />

- ## Guidelines

Feel free to have your own content (style, theme, text, images etc.). But all the functionality and interactions should be there to ensure that you can make interactive things using JavaScript.
