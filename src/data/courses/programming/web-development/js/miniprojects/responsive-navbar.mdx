- ## Task

Make a small component we often see on websites which is a Responsive Navbar, which changes its form based on screen size,
on a large screen it's as a horizontal panel, on a smaller screen it's initially as a button and clicking on it opens a menu-bar. 

An example is given at the below link. 

<LinkMd href="https://virtualvidhya.github.io/miniprojects-js/responsive-navbar/" title="WebPage Preview" />

- ## Main Lessons

This exercise is to understand the practical usage of different DOM concepts in JS for making interactive components in our website.

- ## Guidelines

Feel free to have your own content (style, theme, text, images etc.). But all the functionality and interactions should be there to ensure that you can make interactive things using JavaScript.
